Got it — here’s the step-by-step spec so you can build the ABB diagram yourself in PowerPoint (or whatever you’re using), cleanly and logically for the bottom-third of your ECM slide.

⸻

1. Overall layout
	•	Three horizontal swimlanes stacked vertically:
	1.	Top lane: Issuer (Company)
	2.	Middle lane: Joint Bookrunners (Banks)
	3.	Bottom lane: Institutional Investors
	•	Each lane is a light outlined rectangle spanning the width of the page.
	•	Left margin: lane labels in bold (no background fill).
	•	Inside each lane: place process boxes and arrows.

⸻

2. Core process boxes

Inside the Bookrunners lane (middle):
	1.	Box 1: “Launch (after hours)”
	2.	Box 2: “Accelerated bookbuild (1–3 hrs)”
	3.	Box 3: “Price & allocate”

	•	Use rounded rectangles (soft corners), equal size, evenly spaced left-to-right.
	•	Connect them with thin horizontal arrows (→).

In the Issuer lane (top):
	•	On the right above “Price & allocate,” place a rounded rectangle: “Allot new shares”.

In the Investors lane (bottom):
	•	On the right under “Allot new shares,” place: “Settle shares & cash (T+2*)”.

⸻

3. Vertical flows
	•	Shares down:
From Issuer “Allot new shares” box → vertical arrow → Investors “Settle shares & cash” box.
Label on arrow: “New shares issued”.
	•	Cash up (via Banks):
From Investors box → diagonal arrow to Bookrunners “Price & allocate” box.
Label: “Offer price × allocation”.
	•	Cash up again:
From Bookrunners box → vertical arrow to Issuer lane.
Label: “Proceeds (net of fees)”.
	•	Fees sideways:
From Issuer lane (left of “Proceeds” arrow) → diagonal arrow to Bookrunners lane (earlier stage).
Label: “Fees (gross spread)”.

⸻

4. Callouts
	•	Formula box (small rounded rectangle in bottom-left under swimlanes):

Offer price = Last close × (1 − discount)
Proceeds (gross) = Offer price × New shares
Typical ABB discount: 0–10%


	•	Use of proceeds bubble (small rounded or cloud shape in bottom-right):
“Use of proceeds → Partial bridge paydown”
→ Connect to Issuer lane with a dotted arrow.

⸻

5. Styling
	•	Arrows:
	•	Process flow (within a lane): thin, straight, grey/black.
	•	Cash/share flows (between lanes): slightly thicker, black, with concise labels.
	•	Shapes: light outline, white fill.
	•	Fonts: bold for entity labels, regular for process steps, 9–10pt for arrow labels.
	•	Keep spacing symmetrical so it reads left-to-right like a mini-Gantt.

⸻

6. Reading order when presenting
	1.	Top to bottom to identify the three parties.
	2.	Middle lane left to right (Bookrunners’ process steps).
	3.	Vertical flows: shares down, cash up, fees sideways.
	4.	End on the Use of proceeds callout to link to the DCM timeline.

⸻

If you follow that, you’ll have a simple but elegant ABB mechanic visual that fits the bottom third, supports your “ABB vs Rights” decision, and connects back to the bridge refinancing plan without clutter.

Do you want me to also give you a minimal text-only arrow-flow version you can paste directly into PowerPoint’s SmartArt so you don’t have to position shapes manually?
