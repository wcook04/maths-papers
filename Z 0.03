Base 12m: ~+50 bps (37 bps margin avg + ~10 bps fees).
	•	18m: ~+65 bps.
	•	24m: ~+80 bps.


Got it — you want internal, technical close-outs, not polished “client pitch” one-liners.
Here’s a reworked set of short, matter-of-fact sentences you could drop at the end of each slide to fix the logic in the audience’s mind:

Slide 1 – Strategic rationale
→ “So the strategic fit plus their integration record makes the 9% margin target technically credible.”

Slide 2 – Rating constraint
→ “Everything in the financing plan is structured backwards from the need to stay inside A– thresholds.”

Slide 3 – Phase 1 certainty
→ “The bridge and contingent hedge mean we either close fully funded at a locked price, or we exit with sunk fees only.”

Slide 4 – Bridge structure
→ “Euro is chosen because it matches assets and avoids FX/basis frictions — the bridge is deliberately the launchpad for permanent capital.”

Slide 5 – Bond take-out
→ “The ladder fills maturity gaps and keeps pricing aligned with the A– curve, so the debt half of the take-out is executable.”

Slide 6 – Rights issue
→ “A fully underwritten rights issue is the only way to raise €6bn of equity with immediate deleveraging.”

Slide 7 – Precedents
→ “Precedent RIs of similar scale cleared with high take-up, so execution risk is low if we follow the same structure.”

Slide 8 – Integrated flow
→ “The whole sequence is a ratings-safe rail from signing through permanent capital, with no leakage points.”

Slide 9 – Mizuho role
→ “From an internal view, the structure generates fees in the short term but more importantly proves platform integration.”

Do you want me to tighten them further into pure “sanity-check” phrases (like 5-7 words each) so they land more like a checklist at the end of each slide?
