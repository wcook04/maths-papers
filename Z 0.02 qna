Master Q&A

Strategic and overall

Q: Why do we assume synergies and margin uplift will materialise?
A: DSV has a track record of integrating UTI, Panalpina, and Agility with margin convergence to peer levels.

Q: What if integration runs slower and leverage stays higher for longer?
A: Base and downside cases show rating thresholds maintained with ~0.3x leverage headroom and €2bn liquidity buffer.

Q: What if deal closes at different valuation or timing?
A: Bridge maturity and contingent hedge can be extended or re-struck. Equity and bonds can be resized if required.

⸻

Ratings

Q: Why is preserving A minus non negotiable?
A: S&P requires FFO/Debt ≥45 percent and Moody’s requires Debt/EBITDA <2.5x. Breach risks BBB plus downgrade and spreads widening 25–35 bps across maturities.

Q: Why not accept BBB plus?
A: Lifetime funding cost increases by several hundred million and investor demand weakens.

⸻

Debt Capital Markets

Q: Why a €12bn bridge and not smaller?
A: Full coverage of consideration plus fees with no reliance on markets pre-close.

Q: Why EUR not USD, GBP, or DKK?
A: EUR matches consideration, provides deepest investor base, and avoids FX mismatch. USD adds basis cost, GBP is too shallow, DKK cannot absorb size.

Q: How confident are we in placing €6bn of EUR bonds?
A: Benchmarked against peers such as Daimler Truck, Deutsche Post, Siemens Healthineers. Recent multi-billion prints confirm depth across tenors.

Q: Why issue across five tranches instead of one jumbo?
A: Ladder smooths maturities, reaches different investor pockets, and reduces refinancing risk.

Q: Why stop at 12 year tenor and not go longer?
A: 12 years balances long-end demand with liquidity. Longer tenors or hybrids would increase execution risk and cost.

Q: What if ECB rates move 100 bps before pricing?
A: NIC flex is modelled. Spread corridor still consistent with A minus peers.

Q: How liquid is the secondary market for this size?
A: Secondary turnover in recent large EUR ladders shows strong depth at A category.

⸻

Equity Capital Markets

Q: Why size the rights issue at €6bn?
A: Restores rating metrics within 12 months. Lower size risks downgrade, higher size creates unnecessary dilution.

Q: Why fully underwritten rights rather than ABB or convert?
A: Rights are the only structure delivering €6bn primary proceeds. ABB recycles shares, convertibles too dilutive and misaligned with base.

Q: Why a ~33 percent discount to TERP?
A: Benchmarked to Bayer, Cellnex, National Grid, Telefónica Deutschland which cleared at 30–35 percent discounts.

Q: What is expected dilution?
A: About 19 percent of enlarged base with a 5 for 21 structure.

Q: Can Copenhagen absorb this size?
A: Distribution is pan EMEA. Copenhagen listing is not a constraint.

Q: What is expected take up rate?
A: Above 90 percent at proposed discount corridor. Concentrated long only base supports.

Q: What if volatility spikes above 30 VIX?
A: Underwriting syndicate flex on discount ensures certainty of funds.

Q: What is timeline to settlement?
A: Four to six weeks from launch to cash.

Q: What protections exist for underwriters?
A: Standard flex on discount, allocation rebalancing, and 2–3 percent fee pool.

Q: How do you handle shareholder activism on dilution?
A: Rights structure is pro rata and treats all equally.

Q: Why equity before bonds?
A: Equity reduces leverage first, improves rating perception, and supports tighter bond pricing.

Derivatives and Structured Equity

Q: Why use a deal contingent FX hedge?
A: Provides certainty on EUR consideration without cash settlement if deal breaks.

Q: What size and tenor is required?
A: €11.3bn aligned to purchase price with tenor covering signing to close.

Q: Why not vanilla forward?
A: Requires daily margining and settlement even if deal fails.

Q: Why not options collar?
A: Premium cost and partial protection.

Q: Why not escrow?
A: Ties up cash inefficiently.

Q: What are cost implications?
A: 20–30 bps premium to vanilla forwards, acceptable relative to certainty.

Q: How does hedge accounting work?
A: Not eligible for cash flow hedge. Contingent so derecognised if deal fails.

Q: How is counterparty risk managed?
A: Distributed across bridge banks under ISDA.

Q: What if close is delayed?
A: Re-strike or extend contingent forward.

Q: What is Mizuho’s role?
A: Structuring and executing the hedge, warehousing and distributing risk, and aligning with bridge.

⸻

Liquidity and RCF

Q: What happens to liquidity post close?
A: RCF reset provides €2–3bn committed headroom.

Q: Will RCF be upsized?
A: Yes to reflect enlarged working capital.

⸻

Syndicate and underwriting

Q: How are banks chosen for bridge underwriting?
A: Core relationships plus FX providers sized to distribution capacity.

Q: How are economics allocated?
A: Bridge fees, equity underwriting, and bond bookrunner roles proportional to commitments.

Q: What is Mizuho’s maximum bridge hold?
A: ~€500–700m final hold targeted.

⸻

Legal and documentation

Q: Why Reg S EMTN not 144A?
A: Faster, simpler, sufficient EUR demand.

Q: How is bridge structured for flexibility?
A: Extension options, step up grid, accordion capacity.

⸻

Market risk and contingency

Q: What if EUR IG windows shut for three months?
A: Bridge provides buffer. Equity already settled.

Q: What if windows close entirely?
A: Bridge extension plus staggered issuance into 2026.

⸻

Integration of phases

Q: How is messaging coordinated?
A: Consistent deleveraging narrative. Equity first then bonds.

Q: How are roadshows timed?
A: Rights issue launched post close. Bonds marketed after equity settlement.

⸻

Hedging beyond FX

Q: Why not hedge bridge rates?
A: Tenor short and step up already priced. Swap cost not justified.

Q: Do we need fuel hedges?
A: Operating decision, not transaction linked.

⸻

Regulatory and governance

Q: Are there clearance risks?
A: EU competition review standard. Financing contingent so no pre close cash impact.

Q: What approvals are needed?
A: Board and shareholder approvals for rights issue.

⸻

Sensitivities and downside

Q: What if EBIT margins are 100 bps lower for 2 years?
A: Metrics remain within A minus corridors with equity support.

Q: What if EUR weakens 10 percent vs DKK?
A: Covered fully by contingent hedge.

Q: How much headroom remains?
A: ~0.3x leverage and €2bn liquidity buffer in stress case.

⸻

Mizuho internal

Q: Why is this deal important for Mizuho?
A: Flagship European mandate across multiple products strengthens franchise.

Q: What additional revenue streams are realistic?
A: RCF coordination, working capital, securitisation, and refinancing.

Q: What does success look like beyond league table credit?
A: Sustained role as strategic partner with recurring income streams.
