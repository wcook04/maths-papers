### **Slide 1: Title & Transaction Overview (v2.3)**

*   **A Proposed Strategic Capital Architecture for the Acquisition of DB Schenker**
*   **Transaction:** DSV A/S to acquire DB Schenker from Deutsche Bahn AG.
*   **Deal Value:** **€14.3 Billion Enterprise Value.** This comprises a €11.3bn payment for equity and the assumption of an **estimated** €3.0bn in existing Schenker debt.
*   **The Opportunity:** Deutsche Bahn's formal sales process creates competitive tension. With a stated goal of a **Q2 2025 close**, a swift and certain financing solution is paramount to maintaining transaction momentum.
*   **The Mizuho Solution:** A phased, controlled architecture to navigate the financing and accelerate value creation.

### **Slide 2: Company Profiles & Strategic Fit (v2.3)**

*   **DSV: An M&A Platform Built for Transformational Growth**
    *   **Financial Snapshot (2024E):**
        *   Net Revenue: €22.4bn | EBITDA: ~€2.9bn
        *   **Conversion Ratio: 37.5%** (Highlighting elite operational efficiency)
        *   Pre-Deal Leverage (YE 2024): **Net Cash Position / 0.0x** (Pristine balance sheet)
    *   **Proven Integrator & Capital Discipline:**
        *   Successfully integrated Panalpina & GIL, consistently outperforming synergy targets.
        *   M&A is central to their strategy, requiring a partner that preserves balance sheet capacity for the *next* acquisition.

*   **DB Schenker: A Global Leader with Untapped Potential**
    *   **Financials (2023A):**
        *   Revenue: **€19.1bn** | EBITDA: **€1.9bn**
        *   **Resulting EBITDA Margin: 10.0% (A ~300bps margin opportunity vs. DSV)**
    *   **Market Position & Scale:**
        *   **#1 in European Land Transport**, comprising **41%** of total revenue.
        *   Global network of **~72,700 employees** across **1,850+ locations**.

*   **The Unbeatable Strategic Fit:** This creates the **only global logistics player that can compete with DHL's scale**, with a clear pathway to lift Schenker's margins toward DSV's standards. **The opportunity is clear: apply DSV's proven discipline to Schenker's vast network to unlock significant value.**

### **Slide 3: The Strategic Hurdle: A Fact-Based Risk Analysis (v2.3)**

*   **The Pro-Forma Calculation: The Anchor**
    *   Pro-forma Debt: €4.6bn (DSV) + €11.3bn (New) - €1.5bn (Schenker Cash) = **~€14.4bn**
    *   Pro-forma EBITDA: €2.9bn (DSV) + €1.9bn (Schenker) = **€4.8bn**
    *   **Resulting Unmitigated Peak Leverage = ~3.0x**

*   **The "Fallen Angel" Penalty: The Financial Cost**
    *   A 3.0x leverage peak breaches DSV's stated policy of returning to **<2.0x Net Debt/EBITDA within 18-24 months** and risks their investment-grade rating.
    *   This would trigger a "Negative Outlook," forcing DSV to price new debt like a "Fallen Angel" (BB+ rated credit).
    *   **The Market Fact:** This implies a pricing penalty of **~145 bps** versus stable investment-grade peers (based on current 5yr EUR bond yields).

*   **Strategic Paralysis: The Opportunity Cost**
    *   This financial strain would halt DSV's proven M&A engine, which relies on a strong balance sheet to "reload" for the next acquisition. A simplistic financing makes this rapid deleveraging impossible without severe shareholder dilution.

*   **The Cultural Mismatch: The Wrong Tool for the Job**
    *   The 'lazy' solution of a typical secured, floating-rate Term Loan B is fundamentally incompatible with DSV's established financing DNA of **unsecured, fixed-rate public bonds.**

---

### **Slide 4: Our Solution: The Controlled Deleveraging Architecture (v2.3)**

*   **A Bespoke Architecture, Not a Simple Loan:** We reject a simplistic financing that would damage DSV's credit rating and corporate DNA, in favour of a phased approach that preserves value and strategic flexibility.

*   **The Value Proposition:** Our architecture makes a calculated **€300m one-time investment** in a bridge facility to unlock **over €800m in NPV savings** from superior, investment-grade permanent financing.

*   **The Deleveraging Journey:** Our plan delivers a clear, credible path to the target, driven by tangible financial actions at each stage.

| Phase | Key Actions | Resulting Leverage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Peak** | Unmitigated Pro-Forma | **~3.0x** |
| **Phase 1** (Day 1) | Close with Bridge + **€3bn Cornerstone Equity** | **~2.4x** |
| **Phase 2** (Q3 2025) | Bond Take-Out + **€1.5bn Securitization** | **~2.1x** |
| **Phase 3** (Q1 2026) | FCF Paydown + **€2bn Growth ABB** | **~0.8x** |

### **Slide 5: Phase 1: Certainty, De-Risking, and Execution (v2.3)**

*   **The Goal:** Provide absolute certainty of funds to win the bid, while immediately de-risking the balance sheet and demonstrating a credible deleveraging path to the market.

*   **The Actions & Rationale:**
    *   **LCM - The Certainty Bridge:**
        *   **Instrument:** **€12bn, 12-Month Fully Underwritten Bridge Loan** (Mizuho to lead-arrange).
        *   **Rationale:** Sized to cover the €11.3bn equity purchase plus fees & contingency. The 12-month tenor provides ample headroom for complex EU regulatory reviews.

    *   **ECM - The De-Risking Cornerstone:**
        *   **Instrument:** **€3bn Private Placement** with targeted strategic investors.
        *   **Rationale:** Provides immediate deleveraging, sends a powerful positive market signal, and is faster and more certain than a pre-emptive rights issue.

    *   **DRS - The Economic Lock:**
        *   **Instrument:** Deal-Contingent EUR/DKK Forward to hedge the **€11.3bn** equity consideration, eliminating pre-closing FX volatility for DSV.

*   **The Result: Immediate Deleveraging from 3.0x to 2.4x**
    *   The €3bn cornerstone immediately reduces the debt required at close, driving Day 1 leverage down to a manageable **~2.4x**, preserving the investment-grade rating.

***
* **Fallback Plan:** *In the unlikely event cornerstones decline, we pivot to a fully underwritten Rights Issue to raise €3bn. This provides absolute funding certainty, albeit at a higher potential discount than the preferred cornerstone route.*

### **Slide 6: Phase 2: The Proven Take-Out (Q3 2025) (v2.3)**

*   **The Goal:** Refinance the bridge from a position of strength and accelerate deleveraging using smart, non-core financing tools.

*   **The Narrative (Q3 2025):** We approach the bond market armed with a clear message: **"The integration is working, the synergies are real, and the leverage path is proven."** This is backed by a tangible **€40m synergy run-rate** from initial overhead and IT consolidation.

*   **The Actions & Rationale:**
    *   **DCM - The Investment-Grade Take-Out:**
        *   **Action:** Issue **€7bn in multi-tranche Eurobonds (3Y/5Y/7Y)** to refinance the majority of the bridge loan.
        *   **Benefit:** Establishes DSV's new public benchmark and builds a smooth debt maturity profile at favorable investment-grade pricing.

    *   **SFS - The "Smart" Deleveraging:**
        *   **Action:** Monetize **€1.5bn** of high-quality German trade receivables via a discrete, off-balance-sheet securitization program.
        *   **Benefit:** This funding is **~150 bps cheaper** than other debt and accelerates deleveraging without impacting DSV's core unsecured funding strategy.

*   **The Result: A Clear Path to Target, Hitting ~2.1x Leverage**
    *   The €1.5bn cash from securitization pays down debt directly, driving leverage from **~2.4x down to ~2.1x**—hitting DSV's target range well ahead of schedule.

### **Slide 7: Phase 3: Reloading the Balance Sheet for Future Growth (v2.3)**

*   **The Goal:** Optimize the capital structure and re-arm the balance sheet for the next phase of strategic growth, solidifying DSV's market leadership.

*   **The Narrative (Q1 2026): "The integration is a proven success. Leverage is well below target. We are now optimizing the balance sheet for the next M&A cycle."**

*   **The Result: Final Leverage Reaches ~0.8x**
    *   By deploying free cash flow and executing a "growth capital" raise, we drive final leverage to **~0.8x**, massively over-delivering on the <2.0x target and creating maximum strategic flexibility.
    *   *(Detailed waterfall calculation available in appendix).*

*   **The Strategic Capital Actions:**
    *   **DCM - ESG-Focused Refinancing:** We issue a **€2.5bn Sustainability-Linked Bond (SLB)** to complete the bridge take-out, anchoring the new capital structure and appealing to a deep pool of ESG investors.
    *   **ECM - "Growth Capital" Raise:** We execute a **€2.0bn Accelerated Bookbuild (ABB)**, marketed not as a repair tool, but as **"growth capital"** to re-arm the balance sheet for the next major acquisition.

*   **The Outcome: DSV's M&A Engine is Officially Reloaded**
    *   This aggressive deleveraging creates **maximum optionality** for future M&A, enhanced shareholder returns, and organic investment.

### **Slide 8: The Value Creation Engine: Our Synergy & Integration Blueprint (v2.3)**

*   **The €280m Net Synergy Architecture (Bottom-Up Build):**
    *   **Network Consolidation:** **€100m** (Closing duplicate facilities, route optimization)
    *   **IT & Systems Integration:** **€80m** (Migrating Schenker onto DSV's scalable platform)
    *   **Procurement & Overhead:** **€120m** (Leveraging scale on Schenker's ~70% procured spend)
    *   **Less: Customer Dis-synergies:** **(€20m)** (Conservative allowance for key vertical overlap)

*   **Milestone-Driven Financing Strategy:** Our phased architecture is deliberately timed to these value-creation proof points.
    *   **Q3 2025 – The €40m Run-Rate:** Achieving early IT/Overhead savings **proves the integration thesis to the bond market**, enabling superior pricing on the €7bn take-out.
    *   **Q1 2026 – The €180m Run-Rate:** Demonstrating significant synergy capture **validates the "victory" narrative**, justifying the "growth capital" story for the €2bn ABB.

*   **Based on DSV's Proven Playbook:**
    *   DSV has a **"successful track record with... UTi, Panalpina... and GIL"** following a **"proven framework"** (AR p.38), de-risking execution.
    *   Their **"consolidated, standardised and scalable IT platform"** is ready to absorb Schenker, de-risking the largest synergy component (AR p.11).

*   **The Mizuho Advantage: A Partner Aligned with DSV's DNA**
    *   We recognise DSV's sophisticated capital management and strict adherence to its **public <2.0x leverage policy**. Our architecture is uniquely designed to align with these facts, ensuring targets are met and credibility with investors is maintained.

### **Slide 9: Why Mizuho Wins: A Landmark Mandate for Our CIB Platform (v2.3)**

*   **Strategic Alignment: This Deal IS Our Strategy**
    *   A perfect showcase for our new, **unified CIB model**, requiring seamless execution across LCM, DCM, ECM, SFS, and DRS.
    *   A complex, **"value-added"** mandate that moves us up the value chain and builds a deep, strategic relationship with a future European champion.

*   **Financial Strength: We Have the Underwriting Muscle**
    *   Our robust balance sheet and **22.8% CET1 Ratio** give us the unquestioned capacity to credibly **lead-arrange and underwrite the €12bn bridge facility**, providing absolute certainty to DSV.

*   **Unique Capabilities: Our Differentiated Angle**
    *   **Deep EMEA Presence:** Our regulated German subsidiary (**MHEU**) provides critical local expertise for a complex Nordic-German transaction.
    *   **The Japanese Advantage:** We are the only bank that can finance the deal AND serve as a strategic partner for DSV's post-merger expansion in Asia, leveraging our **pan-Asian platform**.
    *   **Enhanced Advisory:** The recent **Greenhill acquisition** significantly bolsters our strategic advisory capabilities for a transaction of this scale and importance.

*   **Perfect Timing: Why Now?**
    *   Our **"truly transformative year"** (AR p.4) meets DSV's transformative acquisition. Our new integrated CIB structure is battle-tested and ready for precisely this kind of multi-product mandate.

### **Slide 10: Our Commitment: A Superior Outcome for DSV (v2.3)**

*   **Proactive Risk Management: We've Thought of Everything**
    *   **Execution Risk:** Our architecture delivers a resilient **~0.8x final leverage**, providing a massive buffer against synergy shortfalls while retaining significant upside.
    *   **Financing Market Risk:** The bridge's **12+6+6 month structure** provides multiple, independent refinancing windows, de-risking our take-out strategy from any single point of market volatility.
    *   **Regulatory Risk:** The bridge tenor is **purpose-built** around the projected EU approval timeline, not a generic buffer.

*   **The Mizuho Commitment: Why We Are the Only Choice**
    *   **1. Certainty of Close:** **Only Mizuho** combines **€12bn in fully underwritten capital** with a pre-vetted cornerstone strategy to **guarantee** this deal closes, regardless of market conditions.
    *   **2. A True Strategic Partnership:** **Only Mizuho's** integrated CIB platform not only delivers seamless financing but also acts as DSV's **gateway to Asian markets and capital** post-acquisition.
    *   **3. A Launchpad for Future Growth:** **Only Mizuho's** architecture transforms this acquisition into a **~0.8x leverage launchpad**, re-arming DSV for its **next major acquisition** while protecting shareholder value.

***

**With this architecture, DSV doesn't just acquire Schenker—it redefines global logistics while maintaining the financial firepower to lead the next wave of industry consolidation.**
