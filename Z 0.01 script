Got it. Here are tighter, internal-facing speaker notes you can read verbatim. Tone is analytic, decision-led, and aligned to the assessment brief. No em dashes.

Slide 1 — Strategic fit and value creation

“Objective. Frame why this asset improves DSV’s operating model and economics. Fact base. Pro forma revenue about €41.5bn and a clear top tier forwarder. DSV’s Air and Sea engine meets Schenker’s dense European road network on a single IT stack. Execution precedent exists from UTI, Panalpina, and Agility. Implication. Pull Schenker margins toward a 9 percent blended target from a current gap to DSV. This underpins the financing plan we propose later.”  ￼  ￼

Slide 2 — Rating as hard constraint

“Premise. The capital plan is designed to preserve A minus. That informs size, sequence, and instruments. The deck benchmarks this explicitly and shows why downgrade risk raises lifetime cost and weakens demand. Our phases therefore target rating stability first, shareholder optics second, and speed third.”  ￼  ￼

Slide 3 — Phase 1: certainty to signing and close

“Mechanics. Underwrite a €12bn bridge that is committed at signing and undrawn pre close. Pair with a deal contingent EUR DKK hedge sized to the consideration to fix price only if the deal completes. This gives funds and FX certainty at close and zero cash usage if the deal breaks apart from fees. Rationale. It protects consideration, minimises pre close leakage, and preserves balance sheet flexibility for the take out.”  ￼  ￼

Slide 4 — Bridge currency choice and rejects

“Choice. EUR. It matches the target cash flows and taps the deepest natural buyer base for this acquisition. We explicitly reject USD and GBP in this context due to demand mix, basis and optics, and reject DKK on size. The slide flags these as demand or FX, cost or optics, and size rejects. Case references on the page are used only to illustrate execution pathways, not to copy them.”  ￼

Slide 5 — Phase 2 debt: €6bn EUR bond ladder

“Objective. Complete the bridge take out with a €6bn EUR programme via EMTN under Reg S. Structure. 2 year FRN plus 3, 6, 9 and 12 year fixed lines to smooth the curve and target distinct buyer pockets. Timing. Launch after equity to benefit from de leverage and price tension. Role for Mizuho. Coordinate format, sizing, and NIC by tenor across EMEA books.”  ￼

Slide 6 — Phase 2 equity: fully underwritten rights

“Recommendation. Execute a fully underwritten rights issue sized at about €6bn. Target around 20 percent of the enlarged base with an indicative 5 for 21 structure and a standard discount to TERP, consistent with recent European precedents on the page. Rationale. Fast primary proceeds, clean deleveraging signal, and pro rata for all holders. This is the most credible way to defend A minus at size.”  ￼

Slide 7 — Equity execution risk and precedents

“Assessment. Large European rights have cleared with high take up at mid to high discounts in volatility regimes similar to those shown. Our plan aligns with that corridor. Full underwriting addresses tail risk and Copenhagen listing does not impede pan EMEA distribution in practice. Conclusion. Execution risk is manageable with the proposed sizing and sequence.”  ￼

Slide 8 — Integrated funding and risk sequence

“Flow. Board mandate approves the approach and appoints us as MLAB. Signing locks the €12bn bridge and the contingent FX hedge. Pre close the bridge is undrawn and the hedge is contingent. At close we draw, settle FX, and pay the seller. Phase 2 replaces the bridge with €6bn rights and €6bn bonds. Outcome. Liquidity rebuilt and M and A headroom restored, with ratings preservation as the guiding principle.”  ￼  ￼

Slide 9 — Why Mizuho internally

“Near term. We lead the senior commitments, run the hedge, and defend the rating path. Revenue is multi product across underwriting, FX, and distribution. Medium term. We coordinate the permanent capital and the RCF reset to match the new structure. Longer term. We support working capital optimisation and selective securitisation where justified. This is relationship building, league table credit, and recurring income on a flagship European file.”  ￼

If you want, I can drop these lines into your LaTeX notes blocks so you can print presenter notes, and keep the phrasing synced to the assessment brief.  ￼
