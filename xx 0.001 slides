Here’s the refined Slide 0 with your suggested narrative tweaks, ready for a board-level opener:

---

**Slide 0 – Strategic Context: DSV / DB Schenker**

* **Industry ripe for consolidation:** Global 3PL market (\~\$1.2 trn) is highly fragmented (top 10 <30% share), creating a powerful imperative for scale amid cyclical margin pressure and rising compliance costs.
* **Creating a new market leader:** Combined entity becomes #1 freight forwarder by revenue (\~€39 bn pro-forma), challenging DHL and Kuehne + Nagel in both air and ocean freight volumes.
* **Unmatched European density:** Merges DSV’s global Air & Sea network with Schenker’s dominant European land transport platform (1,850+ locations, 130+ countries) for true end-to-end capability.
* **Operational arbitrage opportunity:** Schenker’s lower operating margin vs. DSV’s reflects under-optimised processes — integration offers significant efficiency gains through DSV’s proven M\&A playbook.
* **Strategically positive, execution-sensitive:** Credit agencies expect rapid deleveraging post-close; key integration risks are large-scale IT migration and German labour complexity.
* **Challenging backdrop:** Muted global trade growth and high interest rates heighten the need for disciplined execution; EC review is expected to require targeted divestitures.

For the **visual**, I’d recommend:

**Title:** *Post-Transaction Competitive Landscape – A New ‘Big Three’ Emerges (Pro-Forma 2023 Revenue)*
**Format:** Horizontal bar chart with three bars:

1. DSV/Schenker combined (\~€39B) – stacked shading for DSV vs Schenker contribution.
2. Kuehne + Nagel (\~€25B)
3. DHL Global Forwarding (\~€19B)

Add modal icons (✈️ Air, �� Ocean, �� Land) beside each to signal strengths, and a small source line at the bottom: *Source: Company reports, 2023 data, pro-forma combined for DSV/Schenker.*

Do you want me to prepare that chart for you now so your intern can drop it straight into the deck?

| Lever                           | Precedent Proof                                      | Strategic Impact                    |
| :------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| IT & Network Integration        | UTI → 60% network merged & core TMS migration in <6m | Efficiency gains                    |
| Operational Discipline          | Panalpina → conversion ratio <5pp in 18m             | Raise Schenker margins              |
| Scaled Procurement & Cross-Sell | GIL → enhanced buy-rate power & APAC/ME client wins  | Lower unit cost, higher GP/Shipment |

* **The prize:** €1.0bn+ run-rate synergy in \~3 years; step-up in ROCE <12 months; EBIT: +DKK 3.0bn uplift; No seller financing – acquisition fully funded via committed bridge with rapid deleveraging to A–

---

#### **EBIT Uplift Potential**

**(Bar Chart)**

* **DSV:** 10.6%
* **DB Schenker:** 5.5%
* **Target Margin:** **9.0%**

**Justification for 9.0%:**

* **Ratings-anchored:**

  * *S\&P:* Expect restoration of combined margins to \~10% over the medium term post-integration
  * *Moody’s:* Base case assumes 9–10% operating margin by 2027 as Schenker is lifted to DSV’s current levels
* **Prudent midpoint** of agencies’ forecasts, allowing for integration lag and mix effects
* Supported by €1bn synergy case and historic track record in UTI, Panalpina, GIL
* **Sensitivity:** Assumes stable macro demand and no major dis-synergies during integration.

---

**(Acquisition Timeline)**

* **UTI (2016, USD 1.35bn)** – Loss-making, deficit neutralised in 5m, 40% of DKK 1.5bn in Year 1
* **Panalpina (2019, DKK 35.1bn)**
* **Agility (GIL) (2021, DKK 26bn)** – Complete in 15m, DKK 2.3bn ahead of schedule, upgraded to A-
* **DB Schenker (2024, DKK 106.7bn)**

---

**Current Ratings:**

* **S\&P:** A- / Negative Outlook
* **Moody’s:** A3 / Stable Outlook

### **Value of 'A-' Rating Preservation**

**Preserving 'A-' Rating Avoids €136m-€520m in NPV Costs**

**Our Phased Plan**

| Agency      | Guideline Threshold for Downgrade                 | Baseline (Q3 2024)             | Our Phased Plan                                           |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| **S\&P**    | FFO/Debt < 45% (indicative, sustained)            | DSV: 35.8% \| DB Schenker: N/A | \$\geq\$45% within 12m \$\rightarrow\$ outlook stabilises |
| **Moody's** | Debt/EBITDA \$\geq\$ 2.5x (indicative, sustained) | DSV: 2.2x \| DB Schenker: 1.9x | 2.4x Day-1 \$\rightarrow\$ \$\leq\$ 2.2x by 2026          |

*Note that S\&P gives an 18-month cure window; Moody's tolerance relies on credible rapid deleveraging and other qualitative factors.*

**(Left Side: A scatter plot graph is displayed with two sets of data points, 'A-' in blue and 'BBB+' in red, showing a positive correlation. The axes are not labeled.)**

---

**(Right Side: A table with case studies.)**

| Company             | Misstep Leading to Downgrade                                      | Impact on Future Financing                                |
| :------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| **bpost (2024)**    | Staci buy with debt \$\rightarrow\$ FFO/Debt breach (30%)         | New 23% floor + lasting higher interest                   |
| **Mondi (2025)**    | Debt-buy in downturn \$\rightarrow\$ Debt/EBITDA > 2x             | Liquidity cut to "adequate" \$\rightarrow\$ pricier loans |
| **VF Corp. (2024)** | Acquisition slump \$\rightarrow\$ leverage spike                  | Brand sales to cut debt \$\rightarrow\$ growth curtailed  |
| **Arcelik (2024)**  | Whirlpool Europe deal \$\rightarrow\$ lower margins + higher debt | Higher subordination risk at parent                       |

---

Breaching these thresholds would not only erode value for this capital raise, but also sideline DSV’s serial-acquisition strategy for years and increase the cost of all future refinancing until the rating is restored.

### **Phase 1: Certainty of Funds**

---
Here’s a refined version that keeps your Phase 1 bridge summary **punchy** but removes the confusion between the legal margin grid and the all-in economics.

#### **€12BN SYNDICATE-UNDERWRITTEN BRIDGE**

|                                                     |                                                                                                          |
| :-------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Borrower**                                        | DSV A/S                                                                                                  |
| **Size**                                            | €12,000,000,000                                                                                          |
| **Type**                                            | Senior Unsecured (Dual-Tranche: Bridge-to-Bond / Bridge-to-Equity)                                       |
| **Tenor**                                           | 12 + 6 + 6 months (max 24 months)                                                                        |
| **Contractual Margin Grid**<br>(bps over benchmark) | 0–3m: 25 3–6m: 30 7–9m: 40 10–12m: 50 13–15m: 70 16–18m: 80 19–21m: 100 22–24m: 120                      |
| **A– Rating Case – Effective All-in**               | \~+150 bps drawn start; +20 bps per 6m extension; +250 bps if outstanding beyond planned take-out window |
| **Upfront / Underwrite Fee**                        | \~2.0% one-off (arranger & underwriting)                                                                 |

<small>**Note:** “Contractual Margin Grid” is the facility agreement spread; “Effective All-in” reflects rating premia, liquidity/flex, and extension/penalty economics.</small>

---

This way:

* The **grid** is visible for anyone who wants the legal schedule.
* The **+150/+20/+250** numbers are kept, but clearly framed as an **effective cost lens** for the board/rating discussion.
* The **fee** is labelled properly so it doesn’t look like part of the margin.

If you want, I can also build a **1-row reconciliation table** under this that literally shows “grid + rating premia = all-in” so it’s bullet-proof for Q\&A.

**Timeline:**

* **T0 — SIGNING (today)**
    * Funding: €12bn bridge facility is begun.
    * FX: Deal-contingent Sell DKK / Buy EUR forward executed
    * Upfront fees paid; ticking fee commences from Day+60.
    ↓
* **T1 — CLOSE (~9m)**
    * The €12bn bridge facility is drawn to pay the seller and settle the deal-contingent forward, securing the locked-in EUR purchase price.
    ↓
* **T2/T3 — REFINANCE**
    * The bridge is refinanced via a multi-step process designed to maintain the 'A-' rating.

**If deal fails:**
The deal-contingent forward lapses at zero cost. The bridge is never drawn. Only sunk costs are the upfront/ticking fees.

#### **€11.3BN D-C EUR/DKK FORWARD**

Here’s how that could look:

| **Term**           | **Detail**                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **Instrument**     | Deal-Contingent Forward               |
| **Notional**       | €11.3bn                               |
| **Direction**      | Sell DKK / Buy EUR                    |
| **Tenor**          | \~9 months (Signing → Close)          |
| **Settlement**     | Physical at Close                     |
| **Break Clause**   | Falls away at zero cost if deal fails |
| **Counterparties** | Separate hedge bank(s)                |
| **Pricing**        | Forward rate incl. break premium      |


**Process Flow:**

A flow chart is shown with three main parties (Buyer, Hedge Bank, Bridge Bank) and three phases (Signing, Pre-Close, Close).

|Here’s the **refined table version** with **arrow logic** and **colour coding** built in so it can be translated directly into a clean, intuitive flowchart.

### **Arrow Logic Summary**

* **Commitment Arrows (Signing)**:

  * Bridge Bank → Buyer (**Commit**)
  * Hedge Bank → Buyer (**Hedge**)
    Both originate at Signing, converge into Buyer’s “toolkit” of certainties.

* **Passage of Time Arrow (Pre-Close)**:

  * Single downward arrow from Signing → Close across Buyer’s row (**Time**).
    No lateral arrows — nothing actually moves except fees.

* **Execution Arrows (Close)**:

  1. Buyer → Bridge Bank (**Drawdown**)
  2. Bridge Bank → Buyer (**Funding**)
  3. Buyer ↔ Hedge Bank (**Settlement**)
  4. Buyer → Seller (**Payment**)
  5. Seller → Buyer (**Completion**)

This keeps it **linear**: commitments at Signing, nothing but waiting Pre-Close, then a tight chain of cause-and-effect at Close.

---


This process culminates in the **Seller Transfers Asset**.

### **Phase 2: Permanent Capital (Equity)**

Proceed with a fully underwritten €6.0bn Rights Issue (pre-emptive). Keep an ABB pivot only if the RI window is impaired (vol/illiquidity/timetable).

**(Left Side: Path A)**

#### **Path A — Rights Issue (Primary)**

| Category | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Target Size** | €6.0bn (DKK 44.76bn) |
| **Pre-Launch Baseline** | Shares: 214.0m\<br\>Price: DKK 1,415\<br\>Market Cap: DKK 302.81bn |
| **Discount to TERP** | 33.0% (aligned with 2024 large-cap RI precedents) |
| **Subscription Price** | DKK 878.5 |
| **New Shares Issued** | 50.95m |
| **Rights Ratio** | Approx. 1-for-4.20 $\\rightarrow$ Clean 5-for-21 |
| **TERP** | DKK 1,311.8 |
| **Dilution** | 23.8% of pre-cap\<br\>19.2% of enlarged cap |
| **Pro Forma Shares** | 264.95m |
| **Pro Forma Market Cap** | DKK 347.57bn (= 302.81 + 44.76) |
| **Timing** | Prospectus, rights trading & subscription: \~3–4 weeks\<br\>Settlement: T+2 days |
| **Underwriting** | Fully underwritten\<br\>Fee: 2.0–3.0% (typical for large EU RIs) |
| **Strategic Message** | Fairness + certainty for a transformational deal\<br\>Rating protection on settlement |

**Why Not ABB / Block**

| Option    | Constraints                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ABB**   | AGM headroom (\~10% cap) can’t cover €6.0bn; >1 tranche = repeated overhang; deep discount needed for \~15% supply; partial take-out fails ratings case for A-. |
| **Block** | Secondary only — no primary proceeds; requires large seller (none); no deleveraging or funding benefit.                                                         |

**→ RI only route delivering €6.0bn primary, pre-emptive fairness, full deleveraging certainty, and A- optics.**

**(Right Side Graph: VIX Level)**

A line graph is displayed showing a measure labeled "VIX Level" on the Y-axis. The X-axis displays dates from 01/2024 to 10/2024. The graph shows significant volatility, with a large spike towards the end of the period, which is highlighted with a green background.

VIX re-acceleration compresses issuance windows and widens RI discounts—execute pre-emptively to lock €6bn primary, de-risk the bridge, and preserve ‘A-’ optics before volatility re-prices equity.”

### **From Signing to Permanent Capital: DSV-Schenker Integrated Funding & Risk Strategy**

**Disciplined capital structure enabling ratings preservation and upgrade potential**

**(Flowchart Diagram)**

The slide displays a flowchart detailing a funding and risk strategy, progressing from left to right.
Perfect — here’s the **streamlined grey-box text** for each milestone, ready to drop onto the penultimate slide. Two bullets per box, crisp and board-friendly.

1. **Board Mandate Approved**

* Mandated Lead Arranger; fully underwritten funding certainty secured.
* Rating pathway agreed; execution governance and timelines locked.

2. **SPA Signed & Commitments Locked**

* €12bn dual-tranche bridge committed; mirrors 50/50 equity/debt take-out.
* Deal-contingent EUR/DKK forward executed; zero-cost walk-away if terminated.

3. **Pre-Close (CPs/Regulatory)**

* Bridge undrawn; upfront paid; ticking on undrawn accrues from D+60.
* Hedge contingent; no FX cashflows while CPs and approvals pending.

4. **Close: Draw Bridge & Settle Hedge**

* Draw €12bn; deliver DKK, receive locked EUR via hedge settlement.
* Funding and FX legs synchronised; treasury execution pre-wired and rehearsed.

5. **Pay Seller & Complete**

* Pay seller in EUR at K; legal completion achieved.
* Asset transferred; bridge now live liability awaiting permanent refinancing.

6. **Permanent Capital Take-Out**

* €6bn fully underwritten rights issue; immediate deleveraging, shareholder-pre-emptive.
* €6bn multi-tranche EUR bonds; maturity ladder, natural currency hedge.

7. **Post-Deal Capital Structure (A- Preserved)**

* A- rating preserved; outlook stabilised; liquidity and covenant headroom rebuilt.
* Platform reset for programme M\&A; cost of capital advantage maintained.

*if you want an internal version with owner tags (ECM/DCM/LCM/DRS) layered in, say “owners” and I’ll add a discrete line per box.*

### **What Mizuho stands to gain (Cross selling)**

*(The top of the slide features three large, grey placeholder boxes.)*
Perfect — here’s the **cut-to-core** version that’s tightly tied to this deal and high-probability for monetisation:

| Timeframe       | Opportunity                                               | Client Value                                 | Mizuho Value                     |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| **0–90 Days**   | **Deal hedging (FX / rates)**                             | Certainty on consideration & EPS             | Derivatives P\&L + flow          |
|                 | **AR securitisation – Phase 1**                           | Cheaper than unsecured; liquidity            | Arranger/servicer fees + spread  |
| **3–12 Months** | **Bridge take-out: bonds + equity**                       | Rating-defensive, optimal mix                | Underwriting + distribution fees |
|                 | **RCF refresh / upsize → SLL**                            | Larger backstop; rating comfort              | Commitment fees; margin adj.     |
| **1–3 Years**   | **Working-capital scale-up (AR Phase 2 / selective SCF)** | Structural cash release; supplier resilience | Recurring NII + admin fees       |

If you want it even leaner, drop the last row and keep the first four — that’s the purest “deal-adjacent” set.
