### **Slide 1: Transaction Framing & The Core Problem**

**Headline:** A Transformational Acquisition — but 100% Debt Funding Would Breach Policy and Threaten the Rating

**Deal Snapshot**

| Metric | DSV A/S | DB Schenker | Pro-Forma |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue (€bn) | 22.4 | 19.1 | 41.5 |
| EBITDA (€bn) | 2.9 | 1.9 | 4.8 |
| **EBITDA Margin** | **13.0%** | **10.0%** | **11.6%** |

**Financial Policy & Current Standing**
*   **DSV Target Gearing:** Net Debt / EBITDA consistently below **2.0x** (1.8x as of H1 2024).
*   **Policy Rationale:** This discipline is a cornerstone of maintaining DSV's strong investment-grade **'A-'** credit rating.

**The Unmitigated Leverage Problem**
A simplistic, all-debt financing for the €11.3bn equity purchase results in a capital structure that is fundamentally misaligned with DSV's financial strategy.

*   **Pro-Forma Leverage:** Peak leverage would reach **~3.0x**, immediately and severely breaching the **2.0x** policy ceiling.
*   **Rating Agency Impact:** This breach would almost certainly trigger a downgrade to 'BBB', creating a "fallen angel" scenario.
*   **The Downgrade Penalty:**
    *   **+145 bps** wider credit spread.
    *   **~€130m** in additional annual interest expense.
    *   **~€600m** in Net Present Value (NPV) destruction.

**Key Insight**
> "This is not just about funding a €14.3bn acquisition — it is about architecting a capital structure that preserves the 'A-' rating, protects the cost of capital, and retains DSV’s future **M&A firepower**."

got it — here’s a precise, IB-style build for Slide 1 so you can crank it out fast and have it look properly “banky”.

# Slide objective

Make the audience instantly see: “Great deal, but all-debt breaches policy and threatens the A- rating.” The slide should feel calm, numeric, and decisive.

# Layout grid (PowerPoint)

* Canvas: 16:9. Margins: 0.6" all sides.
* 12-column grid. Gutter: 0.25".
* Regions:

  1. Title bar (full width, 0.9"): headline only.
  2. Left column (cols 1–6): Deal Snapshot table.
  3. Right column (cols 7–12): two stacked cards
     – Policy & Standing (top, \~55% of right column height)
     – Leverage “breach” graphic (bottom, \~45%).
  4. Bottom banner (full width, 0.9"): Key Insight quote.

# Typography & colours

* Font: Calibri (fallback Arial). Numerals tabular if available.
* Sizes: Title 30pt; section headings 14pt ALL CAPS with 120% letter-spacing; body 12pt; footnotes 9pt.
* Palette (safe IB look):

  * Navy #0B2447 (titles, dividers)
  * Steel Grey #4A4A4A (body text)
  * Accent Blue #1B5DBF (section labels)
  * Compliance Green #1E9E62 (good/compliant)
  * Breach Red #C0392B (breach/penalty)
  * Light Grey #F2F4F7 (table row fill)
* Rules: 0.5pt lines in #D9DCE1. No drop shadows.

# Build it step-by-step

1. Title bar

   * Text: “A Transformational Acquisition — but 100% Debt Funding Would Breach Policy and Threaten the Rating”.
   * Left-aligned. Title 30pt, bold, Navy.
   * Add a thin 0.5pt Navy underline rule across the slide.

2. Section label chips (optional but crisp)

   * Place small ALL-CAPS labels above each region: “DEAL SNAPSHOT”, “POLICY & STANDING”, “LEVERAGE IMPACT”.
   * 10pt, semi-bold, white text on Accent Blue rounded rectangle (height \~16pt, 8pt border-radius).

3. Left column — Deal Snapshot table

   * 4 columns (Metric / DSV / DB Schenker / Pro-Forma), exact widths to fill the left column.
   * Header row fill: #EEF1F6; header text 11pt bold, Steel Grey.
   * Body rows: white; alternate the EBITDA Margin row with Light Grey fill to highlight.
   * Alignment: Metric left; numbers right; use thin 0.5pt row rules only (no vertical rules).
   * Number format: one decimal place for €bn; margins as percents with one decimal (e.g., 13.0%).
   * Make the “EBITDA Margin” row bold text in all 3 columns; margin numbers in Compliance Green.

4. Right column (top) — Policy & Standing card

   * Rounded rectangle container (6–8pt radius), white fill, subtle 0.5pt outline #E6E8EC, 12pt internal padding.
   * Small shield icon on the left (use built-in shape), filled Compliance Green with white “A-” text overlay.
   * Copy:

     * “DSV Target Gearing: Net Debt / EBITDA < 2.0x (1.8x as of H1 2024).”
     * “Policy Rationale: Discipline underpins A- rating.”
   * Two bullets max per sub-section; keep to 2–3 lines each.
   * Emphasise “< 2.0x” and “A-” in bold.

5. Right column (bottom) — The “breach” mini-graphic (visual punch)

   * Title (12pt bold): “All-debt financing misaligns with policy”.
   * Build a simple horizontal comparator:

     * Draw a 100%-width baseline bar (height 10pt) in Light Grey.
     * Overlay a green segment from 0 to 2.0 (“Policy ceiling 2.0×”) in Compliance Green.
     * Overlay a red segment from 2.0 to 3.0 (“Pro-forma \~3.0×”) in Breach Red.
     * Add a thin vertical tick at 2.0× with label “Policy 2.0×” (10pt, Steel Grey).
     * Add a red callout tag above the red area: “BREACH → Rating pressure to BBB”.
   * Beneath the bar, 2 concise bullets (12pt):

     * “Peak leverage \~3.0× day-1.”
     * “All-debt path likely triggers outlook/upgrade reversal.”
   * Keep this compact; it’s a glanceable visual, not a chart.

6. Bottom full-width Key Insight banner

   * 0.9” tall, Accent Blue fill, white text 12pt italic or semibold.
   * Place the quote exactly:
     “This is not just about funding a €14.3bn acquisition — it is about architecting a capital structure that preserves the ‘A-’ rating, protects the cost of capital, and retains DSV’s future M\&A firepower.”
   * Add a left-edge vertical highlight bar in Navy (4pt wide) for polish.

7. Footer hygiene

   * Left: “Confidential — For discussion purposes only” (9pt #70737A).
   * Centre: Client/Project name.
   * Right: Page “1” and date “10 Aug 2025”.
   * If you place a logo, make it small (max 22px height), monochrome.

# Micro-details that sell the slide

* Line length: bullets ≤ 90 characters; no more than 4 bullets in the right column.
* Consistent hyphens/en dashes: use en dash “–” for ranges.
* Numerals: keep decimals aligned in the table; use thin spaces for thousands if needed.
* No widows/orphans: adjust line breaks manually in the title so key words don’t dangle.
* Zero animations (export to PDF). If you must: a single “appear” for the breach tag.

# What to literally click/do in PowerPoint (quick recipe)

1. View → Slide Master → set fonts to Calibri; set colour theme with the hexes above.
2. Insert → Shapes → Rounded Rectangle → draw your right-hand cards and bottom banner; set outline to #E6E8EC (cards) or none (banner).
3. Insert → Table → 4×4 → paste your numbers; set header fill; turn off vertical borders; right-align numbers; bold the Margin row.
4. Insert → Shapes → Rectangle for the leverage bar; duplicate and recolour segments; add a narrow line for the 2.0× tick; add text boxes for labels.
5. Add the shield icon: Insert → Icons → search “shield”. Colour green, place “A-” text over it.
6. Add section label chips (rounded rectangles, blue fill, white ALL-CAPS).
7. Add footer text boxes; align with guides; group elements per region.

# Optional variants (if you need to compress)

* If space is tight, convert “Financial Policy & Current Standing” bullets into a two-row mini table with a green “A-” badge in the corner.
* If you want a hero stat, add a small red pill in the title bar’s right end: “All-debt ⇒ \~3.0× > 2.0×”.

If you want, I can mock this in a canvas with exact pixel sizes and spacing for a copy-pasteable template.




### **Slide 2: Strategic Fit & Corporate Finance Rationale**

**Headline:** Industrial Logic: Margin Uplift, Network Fit, and a Proven Integration Playbook

**The Pillars of Value Creation**

1.  **#1 Scale & Market Leadership** ��
    *   Creates the undisputed Global Freight Forwarder with **€41.5bn** in revenue.
    *   Commands a **~7% share** of the fragmented 3PL market, enhancing procurement and pricing power.
2.  **Network Complementarity** ��
    *   **DSV Strength:** Global Air & Sea (58% of 2024 revenue).
    *   **Schenker Strength:** Unmatched European Land/Road transport density.
    *   **Result:** A true end-to-end multimodal offering, managing **2.4m tonnes** of air freight and **4.3m TEUs** of sea freight annually.
3.  **Significant Margin Uplift Potential** ��
    *   **The Gap:** DSV's EBIT margin of **10.6%** is nearly double Schenker's **5.5%**.
    *   **The Levers:** IT platform consolidation, network optimisation, and applying DSV's efficient operating model are the primary synergy drivers.
    *   **The Prize:** Consensus run-rate synergy of **€1bn+**, with a 3-year realisation timeframe.
4.  **Proven Execution Credibility** ✅
    *   **The Playbook:** A repeatable integration model has been proven through the successful acquisitions of **UTi (2016)**, **Panalpina (2019)**, and **Agility GIL (2021)**.
    *   **The Result:** A track record of meeting or exceeding synergy targets provides high conviction on delivering the projected uplift.

**Synergy Waterfall (€bn)**
*(Placeholder for a visual Synergy Waterfall chart)*

**Key Insight**
> "The strategic case justifies the deal. However, it only creates shareholder value if the financing architecture protects the rating and preserves the flexibility for the *next* acquisition."
perfect — here’s an IB-grade build for Slide 2 that matches the look/feel of Slide 1 and makes the “industrial logic” pop in 60 seconds.

# Slide objective

Prove the *strategic* fit in a crisp, de-risked way: scale, network fit, margin uplift, execution credibility — with a clean synergy waterfall.

# Layout grid

* 16:9, 12-column grid, 0.6" margins, 0.25" gutters.

4. Middle right — Proven Execution Credibility card (cols 7–12)

   * Card container as above. Label chip: “EXECUTION PLAYBOOK”.
   * Three “proof chips” in a row (rounded rectangles, very light grey fill):

     * “UTi (2016) ✓” “Panalpina (2019) ✓” “Agility GIL (2021) ✓”.
   * Two bullets (keep tight, 12pt):

     * “Repeatable integration model; synergy delivery on/above plan.”
     * “High conviction on uplift from prior transformations.”

5. Bottom row — Synergy Waterfall (€bn) (cols 1–12)

   * Title (12pt bold): “Run-rate synergy €1bn+ over \~3 years”.

2. Insert → Shapes → Rounded Rectangles for the two middle cards + bottom banner; outline #E6E8EC (cards), none (banner).
3. Insert → Icons → trophy/link/trending-up/shield-check. Recolour to Steel Grey.
4. Margin mini-chart: Insert → Shapes → Rectangles for bars; dashed outline for target; text boxes for % labels.
5. Waterfall: Insert → Chart → Stacked Column; delete legend/gridlines; format series as waterfall by setting negative/positive fills manually (or build with shapes if faster).
6. Add label chips (small rounded rectangles, Accent Blue, white ALL-CAPS) above each section.
7. Align to grid, distribute evenly, snap text to 12pt leading. Group elements per card.

# Optional variants

* If space tight: move the mini margin chart into the Network card footer.
* If more proof needed: add a tiny “Case study” ribbon with one-liner under Execution (e.g., “Panalpina: €xxm synergies in 24m”).

### **Slide 3: The Cost of Doing It Wrong**

**Headline:** “A downgrade to ‘BBB’ costs ~€130m p.a. — ~€600m NPV — permanently”

**(Left Half of Slide) – Rating Agency Trigger Table**

| Agency | Downgrade Trigger | All-Debt Funding | Our Phased Plan |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **S&P** | FFO/Debt < **45%** (sustained) | ~38% → breach | ≥ 45% within 12 m → outlook stabilises |
| **Moody’s** | Debt/EBITDA ≥ **2.5x** (sustained) | 2.7x in 2025 → breach | 2.4x Day-1 → ≤ 2.2x by 2026 |

*Note: S&P gives an 18-month cure window; Moody’s tolerance relies on credible rapid deleveraging.*

**(Right Half of Slide) – Spread Chart & Penalty Calculation**
*   **(Visual: Mini credit curve):** Two dots labelled **A- (~95bps)** and **BBB (~240bps)**, connected by an arrow labelled “+145bps”.
*   **(Visual: Cost call-out box):**
    *   €9.0bn affected × 145bps = **€130m annual penalty**
    *   NPV over 7y @7.5% WACC = **~€600m value loss**

**(Bottom Strip) – Strategic Consequence**
> *"Breaching these thresholds not only destroys ~€600m in value, it locks DSV out of its serial-acquirer playbook for years."*

**Notes for Presentation**
*   **Design Cues:** Use bold **red** for “breach” numbers and green for “compliant”. Keep the curve chart ultra-simple — 2 rating points, no clutter. Put the €130m and €600m in **large font**; they’re the take-home.
*   **Talk-track (45–60 seconds):** “Both S&P and Moody’s have hard triggers — 45% FFO/Debt and 2.5x leverage. All-debt funding breaches them on Day-1. The market prices that breach at 145bps — about €130m a year, ~€600m NPV — permanently. That’s before you factor in the strategic cost: a multi-year pause on DSV’s M&A playbook. Our plan avoids the breach and cures within the agencies’ tolerance windows.”

nailed — here’s a clean, “bank-grade” build for Slide 3 that screams “don’t get downgraded” in one glance.

# Slide objective

Make the cost of a downgrade obvious and painful: red breach, simple curve, big € numbers.

# Layout grid

* 16:9, 12-column grid, 0.6" margins, 0.25" gutters.
* Regions:

  1. Title bar (full width, 0.9")
  2. Left half (cols 1–6): Rating Agency Trigger Table
  3. Right half (cols 7–12): Mini credit curve + penalty box
  4. Bottom banner (full width, 0.9"): Strategic consequence quote

# Typography & colours (same system as Slides 1–2)

* Calibri; Title 30pt; section labels 14pt ALL CAPS; table 11–12pt; footnotes 9pt.
* Navy #0B2447, Steel Grey #4A4A4A, Accent Blue #1B5DBF, Green #1E9E62, Red #C0392B, Light Grey #F2F4F7.
* Rules: 0.5pt #D9DCE1. No shadows.

# Build it step-by-step

1. Title bar

   * “A downgrade to ‘BBB’ costs \~€130m p.a. — \~€600m NPV — permanently” (30pt, Navy).
   * Add a thin Navy underline across slide.

2. Left (cols 1–6) — Rating Agency Trigger Table

   * Label chip above: “RATING TRIGGERS” (white text on Accent Blue pill).
   * 4-column table; header fill #EEF1F6; 11pt bold headers.
   * Column widths: Agency (18%), Trigger (32%), All-Debt (25%), Phased Plan (25%).
   * Formatting:

     * Put trigger thresholds in **bold** within the Trigger column.
     * Colour outcomes: Breaches in **Red** (text + small red dot), compliant/cure in **Green** (text + green tick).
     * Use arrows and time cues tight: “\~38% → breach”, “≥45% within 12 m → outlook stabilises”.
   * Footnote (9pt, grey) under table: “S\&P: 18-month cure window; Moody’s tolerance contingent on credible deleveraging.”

3. Right (cols 7–12) — Spread chart & penalty calculation

   * Top sub-region: Mini credit curve (keep ultra-minimal)

     * Title 12pt bold: “Market spread impact”.
     * Draw a simple x-axis line; plot two dots only:

       * Left dot label: **A- (\~95 bps)**
       * Right dot label: **BBB (\~240 bps)**
     * Connect with a thin arrow; place a small tag above the arrow: “+145 bps”.
     * No grid, no legend, no y-axis.
   * Bottom sub-region: Cost call-out box (the punch)

     * Rounded rectangle (white, 8pt radius, 12pt padding, 0.5pt outline #E6E8EC).
     * Two lines, 18–22pt bold numbers:

       * “€9.0bn × 145 bps = **€130m annual penalty**”
       * “NPV (7y @ 7.5% WACC) = **\~€600m value loss**”
     * Add a tiny calculator icon at left (Steel Grey) for visual anchor.

4. Bottom banner — Strategic consequence

   * Full-width Accent Blue bar; 12pt white italic:
     “Breaching these thresholds not only destroys \~€600m in value, it locks DSV out of its serial-acquirer playbook for years.”

5. Footer hygiene

   * Left: “Confidential — For discussion purposes only”; centre: client/project; right: page “3” and date.

# Table content (paste-ready)

* S\&P row: “FFO/Debt < **45%** (sustained)” | “\~38% → breach” (Red) | “≥45% within 12 m → outlook stabilises” (Green)
* Moody’s row: “Debt/EBITDA ≥ **2.5×** (sustained)” | “2.7× in 2025 → breach” (Red) | “2.4× Day-1 → ≤2.2× by 2026” (Green)

# Visual language & micro-cues

* Use small red/green status dots or ticks before the outcomes for instant scan.
* Keep the credit curve dots 10–12pt; labels right next to dots (no leader lines).
* In the penalty box, make “€130m” and “\~€600m” **larger** than surrounding text.
* Use en dashes (–) and thin spaces for thousands where needed.
* Consistent arrows “→” for state changes.

# What to literally click/do (PowerPoint quick recipe)

1. Insert → Table 4×3; set header fill #EEF1F6; remove vertical borders; set row height \~0.6".
2. Conditional colours: format All-Debt cells Red, Phased Plan cells Green (text only); insert 8px circle icons.
3. Credit curve: Insert → Line for axis; two circle shapes for points; a connector arrow between; text boxes for “A- (\~95bps)” and “BBB (\~240bps)”.
4. Penalty box: Rounded rectangle; two text lines with bold numbers; small calculator icon from Insert → Icons.
5. Bottom banner: full-width rounded rectangle, Accent Blue; paste the quote.

# Optional variants

* If you need more proof: add a micro footnote under the curve “Indicative EUR IG i-spreads; source: desk comps (DD/MM/YY)”.
* If the audience is quant-y: a tiny grey line under the penalty box with the formula “NPV ≈ Annual penalty × annuity factor (r=7.5%, n=7)”.

### **Slide 4: Phase 1: Certainty of Funds**

**Headline:** “Day-1 certainty on funding and FX — sole-underwritten bridge + deal-contingent hedge”

**(Left Half of Slide) – €12bn Sole-Underwritten Bridge Loan (LCM)**
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Provide 100% cash certainty to seller at signing.
    *   Remove syndication risk — **Mizuho sole underwriter**.
*   **Key Terms:**
    *   **Borrower:** DSV A/S
    *   **Amount:** €12,000,000,000
    *   **Type:** Senior Unsecured Bridge-to-Bond
    *   **Tenor:** 12 + 6 + 6 months
    *   **Margin (A-):** EURIBOR + [100] / [150] / [200] bps (step-ups)
    *   **Upfront Fee:** ~[0.75%]
    *   **Ticking Fee:** [30%] of margin after 60 days
    *   **Extension Fee:** ~[0.25%] per extension
*   **Message:**
    *   Aligns with M&A timetable — ready faster than bond markets.
    *   24-month max life gives three bond market windows for take-out.

**(Right Half of Slide) – €11.3bn Deal-Contingent EUR/DKK Forward (DR)**
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Eliminate FX risk on purchase price.
    *   No cost to DSV if deal fails.
*   **Structure:**
    *   **Notional:** €11.3bn (Sell DKK / Buy EUR)
    *   **Tenor:** [9 months] (signing → expected close)
    *   **Embedded premium** in forward rate reflects implied vol (~[4.5%]) + deal-closing probability.
*   **Why deal-contingent:**
    *   Standard forward: Breakage cost if deal fails.
    *   Option: Upfront premium is sunk if deal fails.
    *   **Deal-contingent:** Binding only at close → zero break cost.

**(Bottom Strip) – Core Message**
> *"At signing, we deliver absolute certainty on both funding and FX — de-risking closing for seller, Board, and shareholders."*

**Notes for Presentation**
*   **Design Tips:** Two-column split: LCM left (bridge terms table), DR right (hedge diagram). Use a green shield icon for the “certainty” theme. Keep placeholders in brackets for quick update once you have live pricing and fees.

---

* Container: white rounded rectangle (6–8 pt radius, 0.5 pt outline #E6E8EC, 12 pt padding).
* Sub-section 1 — **Purpose**:
  Two tight bullets (12 pt):

  * “100% cash certainty to seller at signing”
  * “Removes syndication risk — *Mizuho sole underwriter*”
* Sub-section 2 — **Key Terms Table** (3 columns: Term | Value | Notes)

  * Light grey header row (#EEF1F6), 11 pt bold header text.
  * Right-align numeric values, bold the big ones (€12,000,000,000).
  * Use bracket placeholders “\[ ]” in Steel Grey italic until live numbers are available.
  * Step-up margins shown as “+100 / +150 / +200 bps” in stacked format for quick scan.
* Sub-section 3 — **Message**: one concise bullet block (≤3 lines):
  “Aligns with M\&A timetable; 24-month max life = 3 bond market windows for take-out.”

---

### 3) Right column — Deal-contingent FX hedge (DR)

* Label chip: “€11.3BN DEAL-CONTINGENT EUR/DKK FORWARD” (white on Compliance Green).
* Container: white rounded rectangle, same style as left.
* Sub-section 1 — **Purpose** bullets:

  * “Eliminates FX risk on purchase price”
  * “Zero cost if deal fails”
* Sub-section 2 — **Structure mini-table** (Term | Value):

  * Notional: €11.3bn
  * Tenor: \[9 months]
  * Premium: “Embedded in forward rate (\~\[4.5%] implied vol + deal probability)”
* Sub-section 3 — **Why deal-contingent**:
  Visual comparison: 3 small vertical panels labelled “Standard Forward” (red X), “Option” (amber !), “Deal-Contingent” (green ✓) with 1-line pros/cons each.

  * Standard: Break cost if deal fails.
  * Option: Premium sunk if fails.
  * Deal-contingent: Only binds at close → no break cost.
* Optional diagram: timeline arrow from “Signing” → “Close”, showing “FX locked” bar in green, with “Zero exposure” caption.

---

### 4) Bottom banner — Core message

* Full-width Accent Blue rectangle, 12 pt white italic:
  *“At signing, we deliver absolute certainty on both funding and FX — de-risking closing for seller, Board, and shareholders.”*

---

### 5) Footer hygiene

* Left: “Confidential — For discussion purposes only”
* Centre: client/project name
* Right: page “4” and date.

---

## **Visual language & micro-cues**

* Shield icon (Compliance Green) top-left of each card to reinforce “certainty” theme.
* Use ticks (✓) in green for positives; X in red for negatives in the “Why deal-contingent” mini-compare.
* Align both columns so the Purpose, Structure, and Message sections line up horizontally — keeps the banker look.
* Numbers: always align decimals, use thin spaces for thousands, show “×” not “x” for multiplication.

---

## **What to literally click/do in PowerPoint**

1. Set slide master to prior slides’ theme (fonts/colours).
2. Insert → Shapes → Rounded Rectangles for two side-by-side cards (cols 1–6, cols 7–12); outline #E6E8EC.
3. Inside each card, insert a small rounded rectangle for the label chip (Accent Blue left, Green right).
4. Bridge terms table: Insert → Table 3×N; remove vertical borders; right-align numbers.
5. Hedge compare: Insert → 3 rectangles, fill red/amber/green; overlay ✓ or ✗ icons; add 1-line captions.
6. Timeline: Insert → Line Arrow, thick; small green bar for “locked” period.
7. Bottom banner: full-width rounded rectangle, Accent Blue; paste quote text.

---

If you want, I can also give you a **single-slide wireframe** in a ready-to-edit PPT grid so you can drop in numbers the second you get live pricing. That way your Slide 4 will already match the IB formatting from Slides 1–3.




### **Slide 5: Phase 2: Permanent Capital (Debt)**

**Headline:** “€9bn multi-tranche Eurobond take-out — rating preservation worth ~145bps”

**(Left Half of Slide) – Structure & Tenor Logic**
*   **Purpose:** Refinance €9bn of bridge loan within 6–9 months of closing.
*   **Format:** EUR Reg S issuance via MTN programme.
*   **Rationale:** Deepest EUR IG liquidity, natural currency hedge, investor familiarity, execution speed.

| Tranche | Size (€bn) | Tenor | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 3.0 | 3-year | Bank treasuries, short-duration funds |
| 2 | 3.0 | 5-year | Core “benchmark” for real money investors |
| 3 | 3.0 | 7-year | Insurers & pensions, duration match |
*Maturity ladder: Smooth profile, avoids refinancing cliffs.*

**(Right Half of Slide) – Pricing: A- vs BBB**

| Tranche | Peer (Deutsche Post A-) I-Spread* | NIC | **Indicative A- Pricing** | **Indicative BBB Pricing (+145bps)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3-year** | +95bps | +10bps | **~105bps** | **~250bps** |
| **5-year** | +105bps | +10bps | **~115bps** | **~260bps** |
| **7-year** | +115bps | +10bps | **~125bps** | **~270bps** |
*Source: [Placeholder — iBoxx EUR Industrials / syndicate desk data as of DD/MM/YY]*

*   **Impact:**
    *   ‘A-’ structure = c. €X p.a. interest
    *   ‘BBB’ = +€130m p.a. (~€600m NPV) → matches downgrade cost from Slide 3.

**(Bottom Strip) – Execution Strategy**
*   **Lead-left:** Mizuho DCM Syndicate to manage bookbuilding, real-time price discovery.
*   **Target oversubscription:** ≥3x book to tighten final pricing & ensure strong secondary performance.
*   **Investor mix:** Asset managers, insurers, pensions (core); banks, CBs, PBs (support).

**Notes for Presentation**
*   **Design Cues:** Use a two-tone table (green = A- pricing, red = BBB pricing) so the visual gap is immediate. Add a small peer curve graphic in the top-right corner with DSV’s proposed issue dots in each scenario. Keep NIC explanation to a single footnote.
Here’s how to build Slide 5 so it looks like a professional IB “debt execution” page — crisp tables, immediate visual contrast between A- and BBB-pricing, and a smooth maturity ladder.

---

## **Slide objective**

Show that the €9 bn take-out is structured for rating preservation, with pricing proof that A- vs BBB is worth \~145 bps.

---

## **Layout grid**

* **16:9**, 12-column grid, 0.6" margins, 0.25" gutters.
* Regions:

  1. **Title bar** (full width, 0.9")
  2. **Left half** (cols 1–6): Structure & Tenor Logic + ladder
  3. **Right half** (cols 7–12): Pricing comparison table + small peer curve
  4. **Bottom strip** (full width, 0.9"): Execution strategy bullets

---

## **Typography & colours**

* **Fonts:** Calibri, title 30 pt, section labels 14 pt ALL CAPS, tables 11–12 pt.
* **Colours:** Navy #0B2447, Steel Grey #4A4A4A, Accent Blue #1B5DBF, Compliance Green #1E9E62, Breach Red #C0392B, Light Grey #F2F4F7.
* **Rules:** 0.5 pt #D9DCE1. No drop shadows.

---

## **Build step-by-step**

### 1) Title bar

* **Text:** “€9 bn multi-tranche Eurobond take-out — rating preservation worth \~145 bps”
* 30 pt Navy bold; thin Navy underline across slide.

---

### 2) Left half — Structure & Tenor Logic card

* Label chip: “STRUCTURE & TENOR” (white on Accent Blue rounded pill).
* Container: white, rounded corners, 0.5 pt outline #E6E8EC, 12 pt padding.
* Purpose / Format / Rationale bullets at top (tight, 12 pt, ≤2 lines each).
* **Table:**

  * Header row fill #EEF1F6; bold header text.
  * Column widths: Tranche (15%), Size (15%), Tenor (15%), Rationale (55%).
  * All currency in “€ bn” format, right-aligned; rationale in concise text.
* Under table: thin grey line + small italic note “Maturity ladder avoids refinancing cliffs”.
* Optional micro-graphic: horizontal bars staggered at 3, 5, 7 years showing size per tranche (Green fill).

---

### 3) Right half — Pricing: A- vs BBB

* Label chip: “PRICING IMPACT” (white on Compliance Green).
* **Table:**

  * Header row fill #EEF1F6.
  * Columns: Tranche | Peer I-Spread | NIC | Indicative A- Pricing | Indicative BBB Pricing (+145 bps).
  * Fill A- Pricing cells Compliance Green, BBB Pricing cells Breach Red for instant contrast.
  * Right-align numeric values; bold key spreads (e.g., **\~105bps**, **\~250bps**).
  * Footnote in 9 pt grey: “Source: \[Placeholder — iBoxx EUR Industrials / syndicate desk data DD/MM/YY]”.
* Small peer curve mini-chart in top-right corner of the card:

  * X-axis = tenor; Y-axis = spread.
  * Plot Deutsche Post A- curve (grey line) and overlay DSV issue dots in Green (A-) vs Red (BBB).
  * Keep it tiny (≈1.5" wide) and clean — no gridlines.

---

### 4) Bottom strip — Execution Strategy

* Full-width Accent Blue bar, white text, 12 pt.
* Three concise bullets:

  * “Lead-left Mizuho DCM Syndicate: manage bookbuilding, real-time pricing.”
  * “Target ≥ 3× oversubscription to tighten final pricing & boost secondary performance.”
  * “Investor mix: asset managers, insurers, pensions (core) + banks, CBs, PBs (support).”

---

## **Visual cues & micro-details**

* Keep NIC column small; show “+10bps” consistently formatted.
* Use “×” not “x” for multiplication in any calc references.
* Align decimals vertically in pricing columns.
* For the maturity ladder graphic, match Green to A-pricing fill to reinforce the message.
* Peer curve dots: small, 10 pt; labels directly adjacent (no leader lines).

---

## **PowerPoint click-path**

1. Copy theme from prior slides.
2. Insert → Shapes → Rounded Rectangles for left/right cards; apply outline and padding.
3. Insert → Table for both sides; remove vertical borders; header fill #EEF1F6.
4. Apply fill colours to pricing columns (Green/Red).
5. Mini-chart: Insert → Scatter chart; format as per above; remove legend, gridlines.
6. Bottom banner: full-width rectangle, Accent Blue fill, white text.

---

If you want, I can also give you a **wireframe version** with the ladder graphic and pricing table already aligned so you just paste in the live numbers and the peer curve screenshot. That keeps the IB polish consistent from Slide 1 through Slide 5.


---

### **Slide 6: Phase 2: Permanent Capital (Equity)**

**Headline:** “€3bn ABB with rights-issue pivot — balancing speed, fairness & certainty”

**(Left Half of Slide) – Strategic Rationale**
*   **Preserve ‘A-’ rating:** Immediate leverage reduction from ~3.0× → <2.0×.
*   **Diversify funding:** Protects debt capacity for future M&A.
*   **Investor confidence:** Large equity raise signals commitment to balance sheet strength.
*   **Core message:** *Equity is non-negotiable for rating preservation and market signalling.*

**(Middle of Slide) – Hybrid Structure**

| Path | Mechanism | When used | Advantages |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A – Accelerated Bookbuild (ABB)** | Overnight institutional placement | **Stable** markets | Fastest execution, minimal market exposure |
| **B – Fully underwritten Rights Issue pivot** | Pre-documented, pro-rata rights offering | **Volatile** markets | Absolute proceeds certainty, shareholder fairness |
*Execution logic: Pre-mandate both structures; decide at launch based on market conditions.*

**(Right Half of Slide) – Execution Metrics (placeholders)**
*   **Path A – €3.0bn ABB**
    *   Size: ~8.9% of market cap (~12× ADTV)
    *   Discount planning: **2.5–4.0%** vs close
    *   Cornerstone coverage target: ≥50% pre-launch via wall-crossing
    *   Allocation bias: long-only, global institutions
*   **Path B – €3.0bn Rights Issue**
    *   Fully underwritten by Mizuho
    *   Pre-emptive: all shareholders maintain stake
    *   Pricing vs **TERP** (discount TBD)
    *   Timeline: ~3–4 weeks to completion

**(Bottom Strip) – Differentiation from Reality**
*   DSV’s actual deal: €5.5bn ABB (largest in a decade) at <1% discount, 56% cornerstone.
*   **Our strategy:** Smaller (€3bn) raise for lower dilution, with rights-issue pivot for volatility insurance — *maximises flexibility and protects rating under all market conditions.*

**Notes for Presentation**
*   **Design Cues:** Use a two-path graphic: ABB arrow in green, Rights Issue arrow in blue, meeting at “€3bn equity raised” endpoint. Use iconography for “Speed” (lightning bolt) and “Certainty” (shield). Keep cornerstone investor names in small print under the ABB section as credibility markers.

---Here’s how to structure Slide 6 so it reads like a polished IB execution slide, and the “speed vs certainty” trade-off is instantly clear.

---

## **Slide objective**

Sell the hybrid equity approach as smart, flexible, and rating-preserving — while clearly contrasting ABB and Rights Issue execution.

---

## **Layout grid**

* **16:9**, 12-column grid, 0.6" margins, 0.25" gutters.
* Regions:

  1. **Title bar** (full width, 0.9")
  2. **Left third** (cols 1–4): Strategic Rationale
  3. **Middle third** (cols 5–8): Hybrid Structure table
  4. **Right third** (cols 9–12): Execution Metrics
  5. **Bottom banner** (full width, 0.9"): Differentiation from reality

---

## **Typography & colours**

* **Font:** Calibri; Title 30 pt; section labels 14 pt ALL CAPS; tables 11–12 pt; footnotes 9 pt.
* **Colours:** Navy #0B2447, Steel Grey #4A4A4A, Accent Blue #1B5DBF, Green #1E9E62, Blue #0070C0, Light Grey #F2F4F7.
* **Rules:** 0.5 pt #D9DCE1.
* Icons flat/monochrome.

---

## **Build step-by-step**

### 1) Title bar

* Headline in 30 pt Navy bold:
  **“€3 bn ABB with rights-issue pivot — balancing speed, fairness & certainty”**
* Thin Navy underline.

---

### 2) Left third — Strategic Rationale card

* Label chip: “STRATEGIC RATIONALE” (white on Accent Blue rounded pill).
* White rounded rectangle container, 0.5 pt outline #E6E8EC, 12 pt padding.
* Four bullets (12 pt, ≤2 lines each):

  * Preserve A-rating: 3.0× → <2.0×
  * Diversify funding, protect debt headroom
  * Signal balance sheet strength
  * *Equity non-negotiable for rating preservation*
* Add small shield icon (Green) at top-right for “rating protection” cue.

---

### 3) Middle third — Hybrid Structure table

* Label chip: “HYBRID STRUCTURE” (white on Green).
* **4-column table**: Path | Mechanism | When Used | Advantages.
* Header fill #EEF1F6; bold 11 pt headers.
* Row A in **Green** path label; Row B in **Blue** path label.
* Keep text tight (≤40 chars per cell).
* Italic footnote below: “Execution logic: Pre-mandate both; decide at launch.”

---

### 4) Right third — Execution Metrics cards

* Split vertically into two small cards stacked:
  **Path A – ABB** (Green header) and **Path B – Rights Issue** (Blue header).
* Each card: 12 pt bullets, key numbers bold.

  * ABB: Size, discount, cornerstone %, allocation bias.
  * Rights: Underwriting, pre-emptive nature, pricing vs TERP, timeline.
* Add icons:

  * ABB card: lightning bolt (Speed).
  * Rights card: shield (Certainty).
* Small print under ABB bullets: “Cornerstones: \[names]” (for credibility).

---

### 5) Connecting visual (optional but powerful)

* Between Middle and Right thirds, add two arrows:

  * Green arrow from ABB card, Blue arrow from Rights card → merge at a central box “€3 bn Equity Raised” (Navy fill, white text).
* This reinforces both paths lead to same funding outcome.

---

### 6) Bottom banner — Differentiation from reality

* Full-width Accent Blue rectangle, white text 12 pt:
  “Actual deal: €5.5 bn ABB (<1% discount, 56% cornerstone). Our plan: €3 bn with rights-issue pivot — lower dilution, volatility insurance.”

---

## **Visual & micro-cues**

* Use colour coding consistently: Green = ABB, Blue = Rights.
* Keep numbers bold in bullets for scanability.
* Align table columns perfectly with grid gutters.
* Keep arrow merges perfectly centred — avoid messy overlaps.
* Use thin spaces for thousands in %/€ figures.

---

## **PowerPoint click-path**

1. Copy master from prior slides.
2. Insert → Shapes → Rounded Rectangles for three main columns; outline #E6E8EC.
3. Hybrid Structure table: Insert table 4×3, colour first-column cells Green/Blue.
4. Execution Metrics: Two smaller rounded rectangles stacked in right third; fill headers Green/Blue; bullets inside.
5. Insert → Icons for lightning bolt/shield; recolour white and place in header fills.
6. Optional central “merge” graphic: Insert → Arrows for path lines, merge into Navy-filled box.

---

Do you want me to also give you a **diagram layout** for the ABB / Rights arrows merge? That’s the bit that usually makes this slide look “top-tier bank” when done cleanly.




### **Slide 7: Phase 3: Deleveraging Path**

**Headline:** “Disciplined capital structure — rating preservation and upgrade potential”

**(Left Half of Slide) – Chart: “Leverage walk”**
*   **X-axis:** Time (2024 – 2027)
*   **Y-axis:** Net debt / EBITDA (x)
*   **(Chart Data Points):**
    *   **Starting point:** 3.0× (2024 pro-forma peak, Moody’s validated)
    *   **Day-1 post-financing:** 2.4× (after €9bn debt take-out + €3bn equity)
    *   **Year 1:** 1.8× (synergies + FCF applied to debt)
    *   **Steady state:** <1.5× by 2027
*   **(Chart Features):**
    *   Solid blue line = projected leverage trajectory.
    *   Horizontal red dashed line at 2.0× = **policy ceiling** (Moody’s and company commitment).
    *   Green shaded zone <1.5× = **upgrade potential range** (Moody’s criteria).
    *   **(Annotations on Chart):**
        *   “€400m synergies p.a.”
        *   “~DKK 17bn CFO p.a., capex ~1.5% rev”
        *   “Debt repayment priority until below 2.0×”

**(Right Half of Slide) – Justification from Moody’s**
*   **Starting point & policy ceiling**
    *   Peak 3.0× in 2024 including acquisition debt (Moody’s base case).
    *   2.0× = stated net debt/EBITDA cap; buybacks only resume below this level.
*   **Drivers of deleveraging**
    *   Proven M&A integration record — Schenker EBIT/employee ~½ DSV’s; 25–30% opex gap.
    *   Conservative synergy assumption €400m vs Moody’s €1bn+ base case.
    *   Strong cash generation: DKK 17bn CFO in first 12 months, low capex (1.5% revenue).
    *   Explicit policy to direct surplus cash to debt repayment until below target gearing.
*   **Steady state target (<1.5×)**
    *   Aligns with Moody’s upgrade trigger for “sustainably below 1.5×”.
    *   Agency forecasts 1.4× by 2027 — achievable, supports long-term M&A capacity.

**(Bottom Strip) – Core Message**
> *"We deliver a rapid, credible reduction in leverage from 3.0× to <1.5× — preserving the ‘A-’ rating and creating headroom for future strategic growth."*

**Notes for Presentation**
*   **Design Cues:** Use a clean 4-point trajectory with discrete dots for 3.0× → 2.4× → 1.8× → 1.4×. Use a red dashed policy ceiling line and a green shaded upgrade zone. Keep the chart visually dominant — right-side bullets in concise, proof-driven style. Use the Moody’s logo in a corner for credibility.

---
Here’s how I’d design Slide 7 so it looks like a “rating-agency-ready” IB deliverable — with the leverage chart as the hero visual and Moody’s justification as tight supporting text.

---

## **Slide objective**

Show that the deleveraging path is credible, rapid, and aligned with rating agency triggers — using the chart as the primary takeaway.

---

## **Layout grid**

* **16:9**, 12-column grid, 0.6" margins, 0.25" gutters.
* **Regions:**

  1. **Title bar** (full width, 0.9")
  2. **Left half** (cols 1–6): Leverage walk chart with annotations
  3. **Right half** (cols 7–12): Moody’s justification bullets
  4. **Bottom banner** (full width, 0.9"): Core message

---

## **Typography & colours**

* **Font:** Calibri; Title 30 pt; section labels 14 pt ALL CAPS; bullets 12 pt; footnotes 9 pt.
* **Colours:** Navy #0B2447, Steel Grey #4A4A4A, Accent Blue #1B5DBF, Green #1E9E62, Red #C0392B, Light Grey #F2F4F7.
* **Chart palette:** Blue line, Green shaded zone, Red dashed ceiling line.
* **Lines:** 0.5 pt #D9DCE1 (non-primary chart elements).

---

## **Build step-by-step**

### 1) Title bar

* **Text:** “Disciplined capital structure — rating preservation and upgrade potential”
* 30 pt Navy bold; thin Navy underline across slide.

---

### 2) Left half — Leverage walk chart

* Chart type: **Line chart with markers** (4 discrete dots).
* **X-axis:** Years 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027.
* **Y-axis:** Net debt / EBITDA (0.0× – 3.5× range).
* **Data points:**

  * 2024 peak: 3.0× (Red label “Pro-forma peak”).
  * Day-1 post-financing: 2.4× (Blue dot).
  * Year 1: 1.8× (Blue dot).
  * Steady state 2027: 1.4× (Green dot).
* **Elements:**

  * Solid Blue line connecting points.
  * **Horizontal red dashed line** at 2.0×, labelled “Policy ceiling”.
  * **Green shaded area** under 1.5×, labelled “Upgrade potential zone”.
  * Annotation callouts:

    * Near 2025 point: “€400m synergies p.a.”
    * Between 2025–2026: “\~DKK 17bn CFO p.a., capex \~1.5% rev”
    * Near 2.0× line: “Debt repayment priority until below 2.0×”.
* Axis labels in Steel Grey; no gridlines except light Y-axis lines for clarity.

---

### 3) Right half — Moody’s justification

* Label chip: “MOODY’S VIEW” (white on Accent Blue rounded pill).

* White rounded rectangle container, 0.5 pt outline #E6E8EC, 12 pt padding.

* **Bullets (grouped in 3 sub-headings):**

  * **Starting point & policy ceiling**

    * Peak 3.0× (2024 pro-forma, Moody’s base case)
    * 2.0× cap; buybacks resume only below
  * **Drivers of deleveraging**

    * Proven M\&A integration record; 25–30% opex gap
    * €400m conservative synergy assumption
    * DKK 17bn CFO in year 1; capex 1.5% rev
    * Surplus cash → debt until <2.0×
  * **Steady state target (<1.5×)**

    * Aligns with upgrade trigger
    * Moody’s forecasts 1.4× by 2027

* Small **Moody’s logo** in bottom-right corner of the card for credibility.

---

### 4) Bottom banner — Core message

* Full-width Accent Blue rectangle, white italic 12 pt text:
  *“We deliver a rapid, credible reduction in leverage from 3.0× to <1.5× — preserving the ‘A-’ rating and creating headroom for future strategic growth.”*

---

## **Visual & micro-cues**

* **Dots:** Use red for 3.0×, blue for mid-points, green for 1.4× to reinforce progress.
* Keep the red dashed ceiling line thin but noticeable; label above the line.
* Shaded upgrade zone should be subtle (20% opacity green).
* Ensure bullets are short; use bold on key ratios and € figures.
* Align chart and bullet card perfectly to top/bottom guides.

---

## **PowerPoint click-path**

1. Insert → Chart → Line with Markers; enter 4 points; remove legend/gridlines.
2. Add horizontal line (Insert → Shapes → Line) at 2.0×; format dashed red.
3. Draw a green rectangle for upgrade zone; send to back; set transparency.
4. Add callouts: Insert → Shapes → Callout, fill white, outline #E6E8EC.
5. Insert → Rounded Rectangle for Moody’s bullets; add label chip.
6. Bottom banner: full-width rectangle, Accent Blue fill, white italic text.

---

If you like, I can sketch a **mock-up of the leverage chart** in the correct colour palette so you can drop it straight into the left half without fiddling with formatting. Would you like me to do that?



### **Slide 8: Optional Optimisation: SFS (Securitisation)**

**Headline:** “€1.5bn receivables securitisation — low-cost funding to accelerate deleveraging”

**(Left Half of Slide) – Visual: “Leverage impact”**
*   **(Bar chart or small waterfall visual showing):**
    *   **Starting leverage:** 2.7× (H1 2025, Moody’s/S&P confirmed)
    *   **Without SFS:** H1 2027 back to <2.0× (company guidance)
    *   **With SFS:** <2.0× reached **12 months earlier** → within S&P’s 18-month rating-stability window.
*   Highlight a €1.5bn SFS proceeds arrow pointing to debt repayment.
*   Overlay a red dashed **2.0× policy ceiling** and a green zone below the target.

**(Right Half of Slide) – Justification & Benefits**
1.  **Proven structure, zero execution risk**
    *   S&P’s 2024 report confirms existing DSV receivables securitisation (~€270m); this proposal simply scales it up post-merger.
    *   No need for new operational capability — treasury is already familiar with the mechanics.
2.  **Strong underlying asset base**
    *   H1 2025 combined trade receivables: **DKK 45.3bn (~€6.1bn)**.
    *   €1.5bn programme = <25% of pool → highly over-collateralised, attractive to investors.
3.  **Accelerates deleveraging**
    *   €1.5bn used to repay acquisition debt reduces peak 2.7× leverage faster.
    *   Achieves <2.0× within S&P’s 18-month “Negative → Stable” window.
4.  **Funding cost advantage**
    *   SFS priced **~150 bps inside** unsecured EUR bonds.
    *   ≈€22.5m annual interest saving vs. like-for-like bond funding.
5.  **Supports integration without equity**
    *   H1 2025: integration & transaction costs **DKK 11.0bn (~€1.48bn)**, €270-335m in 2025 alone.
    *   SFS provides efficient liquidity for one-off cash outflows without tapping the RCF or issuing expensive debt.

**(Bottom Strip) – Core Message**
> *"Upsizing a proven securitisation programme unlocks €1.5bn at a lower cost than bonds — accelerating deleveraging, protecting the ‘A-’ rating, and funding integration without further equity dilution."*

---Here’s how I’d design Slide 8 so it reads like a crisp, optional optimisation idea — with the left side giving the *visual punch* of the leverage improvement and the right side selling the “low-risk, high-benefit” case.

---

## **Slide objective**

Show that upsizing securitisation delivers faster leverage reduction, cheaper funding, and avoids extra equity — without operational risk.

## **Layout grid**

* **16:9**, 12-column grid, 0.6" margins, 0.25" gutters.
* Regions:

  1. **Title bar** (full width, 0.9")
  2. **Left half** (cols 1–6): Leverage impact chart + SFS proceeds arrow
  3. **Right half** (cols 7–12): Justification & Benefits list
  4. **Bottom banner** (full width, 0.9"): Core message

---

## **Typography & colours**

* Font: Calibri; Title 30 pt; section labels 14 pt ALL CAPS; bullets 12 pt; footnotes 9 pt.
* Colours: Navy #0B2447, Steel Grey #4A4A4A, Accent Blue #1B5DBF, Green #1E9E62, Red #C0392B, Light Grey #F2F4F7.
* Chart: Blue bars for baseline, Green bars for “With SFS”, Red dashed horizontal at 2.0×.

---

## **Build step-by-step**

### 1) Title bar

* Text: **“€1.5 bn receivables securitisation — low-cost funding to accelerate deleveraging”**
* 30 pt Navy bold; thin Navy underline.

---

### 2) Left half — Leverage impact visual

* **Chart type:** Simple clustered column chart or 3-stage waterfall.
* **X-axis:** H1 2025, H1 2027 “Without SFS”, H1 2027 “With SFS”.
* **Y-axis:** Net debt / EBITDA (x).
* **Values:** 2.7× → 2.0× → \~1.9× (example for With SFS).
* Blue bars for “Starting” & “Without SFS”; Green bar for “With SFS”.
* Overlay **Red dashed line** at 2.0× with label “Policy ceiling”.
* Add **Green shaded zone** below 2.0×.
* Draw **curved arrow** labelled “€1.5 bn SFS proceeds” pointing from “With SFS” bar toward a “Debt repayment” icon (banknote or € symbol).
* Annotate: “<2.0× achieved 12 months earlier” in Green.

---

### 3) Right half — Justification & Benefits

* Label chip: “WHY IT WORKS” (white on Accent Blue rounded pill).
* White rounded rectangle container (0.5 pt outline #E6E8EC, 12 pt padding).
* Numbered list 1–5 (12 pt, ≤2 lines each), with **key numbers in bold**:

  1. Proven structure — S\&P confirms existing \~€270 m; just scaling.
  2. Strong asset base — DKK 45.3 bn receivables; €1.5 bn = <25% pool.
  3. Accelerates deleveraging — meets S\&P’s 18-month stability window.
  4. Cost advantage — \~150 bps inside unsecured; saves ≈€22.5 m p.a.
  5. Supports integration — funds €1.48 bn integration costs without equity.
* Add small icons to the left of each point (shield, database, speed arrow, € sign, handshake).

---

### 4) Bottom banner — Core message

* Full-width Accent Blue rectangle; 12 pt white italic text:
  *“Upsizing a proven securitisation programme unlocks €1.5 bn at a lower cost than bonds — accelerating deleveraging, protecting the ‘A-’ rating, and funding integration without further equity dilution.”*

---

## **Visual & micro-cues**

* Ensure the Red dashed policy ceiling line runs across the full chart, not just the bars.
* Use consistent bar widths; colour-code “With SFS” Green to match opportunity tone.
* Keep bullet text tight — 8–10 words before a number, then bold the number.
* Use alignment so chart baseline aligns with the top of the right-hand card.

---

## **PowerPoint click-path**

1. Insert → Chart → Column; enter 3 data points; format fills (Blue/Green); delete legend/gridlines.
2. Draw line at 2.0×; format dashed Red; add label above.
3. Draw rectangle (Green fill, 20% opacity) for <2.0× zone; send to back.
4. Insert → Shapes → Curved Arrow for SFS proceeds; add label in bold.
5. Create rounded rectangle for bullets; add label chip at top; insert icons.
6. Bottom banner: full-width rounded rectangle, Accent Blue fill, white text.

---

Do you want me to also mock up the **exact leverage impact chart** with the bars, arrow, and overlays so you can paste it straight into the left half of the slide? That’s usually the hardest part to make look clean in PPT.




### **Slide 9: Risk Matrix & Mitigation**

**Headline:** “Four key risks — each met with a built-in, technical solution”

**Core Table – One-to-one mapping of risks to mitigants**

| **Risk** | **Pre-embedded Mitigant** | **Quantified Impact of Mitigant** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FX Risk** | €11.3bn **deal-contingent forward** (EUR/DKK) — activates only if deal closes; nullifies otherwise. | EUR purchase price fixed at signing; **zero breakage cost** if deal fails. |
| **Refinancing Risk** | **12+6+6 month bridge** — three separate bond market windows to refinance (€9bn Eurobond take-out). | >12 months buffer beyond base case; avoids forced issuance in adverse markets. |
| **Synergy / Execution Risk** | **Target leverage <1.5×** vs 2.0× policy ceiling → **~0.5× headroom** (~€2.4bn EBITDA equivalent). | Rating protected even with partial synergy delivery or macro slowdown. |
| **Equity Market Risk** | **Pre-negotiated rights-issue pivot** — fully underwritten by Mizuho if ABB conditions are unstable. | €3.0bn equity is **guaranteed** under all market scenarios. |

**Bottom Annotations – Context & Stress-Test Points**
*   **Regulatory timing buffer:** Base case assumes Q2 2025 close; 24-month bridge life provides >12 months contingency if clearance is delayed.
*   **Social undertakings in Germany:** Two-year employee protections may slow synergy capture; **~€2.4bn EBITDA cushion** covers the delay without breaching leverage targets.
*   **Alignment with rating agencies:** S&P “Negative” outlook is tied to restoring metrics within 18 months — our mitigants ensure this window is met or beaten.

**Notes for Presentation**
*   **Design Cues:** Use a clean 2×3 table layout with icons per risk (e.g., currency symbol, clock, factory, chart line). Use a green tick overlay in the “Mitigant” column to emphasise each risk is fully addressed. Use subtle red/yellow/green dots in the “Risk” column to indicate severity before mitigation.
Here’s how to make Slide 9 look like a polished IB “risk control” slide — simple, visual, and confidence-building.

---

## **Slide objective**

Show the committee/Board that every major risk already has a *built-in, specific, and credible* mitigant — with quantified impact.

---

## **Layout grid**

* **16:9**, 12-column grid, 0.6" margins, 0.25" gutters.
* Regions:

  1. **Title bar** (full width, 0.9")
  2. **Main table** (cols 1–12, \~70% height) — 2×3 layout with icons and colour cues
  3. **Bottom strip** (full width, 0.9") — Context & stress-test notes

---

## **Typography & colours**

* Font: Calibri; Title 30 pt; section labels 14 pt ALL CAPS; table text 11–12 pt; footnotes 9 pt.
* Colours: Navy #0B2447, Steel Grey #4A4A4A, Accent Blue #1B5DBF, Compliance Green #1E9E62, Amber #FFB300, Breach Red #C0392B, Light Grey #F2F4F7.
* Icons: flat, monochrome, recoloured to match severity status.
* Lines: 0.5 pt #D9DCE1.

---

## **Build step-by-step**

### 1) Title bar

* Text: **“Four key risks — each met with a built-in, technical solution”**
* 30 pt Navy bold; thin Navy underline.

---

### 2) Main table — 2×3 visual matrix

**Structure:**

* Top row = headings: Risk | Pre-embedded Mitigant | Quantified Impact.
* Two rows of content in **two “panels” per row** (effectively 4 mini-cards arranged as a grid).

**Formatting:**

* Row header cells (Risk column) get a small severity dot before the text:

  * Red dot for high severity before mitigation (e.g., FX, Synergy).
  * Amber for moderate (Refinancing, Equity Market).
* Next to each Risk text, place a relevant flat icon (currency symbol, clock, factory/gear, bar chart/line).
* Mitigant column: bold the instrument name (**deal-contingent forward**, **12+6+6 month bridge**, etc.) and add a small green tick overlay icon in the top-right corner of the cell to signal “solved”.
* Impact column: bold the key numbers (**zero breakage cost**, **\~0.5× headroom**, **€3.0bn equity guaranteed**).

**Design details:**

* Header row fill #EEF1F6; bold white text on Navy or dark grey headers.
* No vertical borders; light horizontal row dividers only.
* Equal column widths so text wraps evenly; keep each cell to 2–3 lines max.

---

### 3) Bottom strip — Context & stress-test notes

* Accent Blue bar (or white box with blue border if you want lighter look).
* Three concise bullets (12 pt, no wrap beyond 2 lines):

  * “Regulatory timing buffer: 24-month bridge gives >12 m contingency.”
  * “Social undertakings may slow synergies; €2.4 bn EBITDA cushion covers delay.”
  * “Alignment with rating agencies: meets/betters S\&P’s 18-month cure window.”

---

## **Visual & micro-cues**

* Align icons in Risk column to left margin, with text indented to clear icon.
* Keep Mitigant column in one colour tone (black text + green tick) so it feels “controlled”.
* In Impact column, highlight headline metric in bold and leave the rest in Steel Grey for scanability.
* Maintain equal white space above and below text in each cell for balance.

---

## **PowerPoint click-path**

1. Insert → Table → 3×5 (header + 4 risks) → set column widths equal.
2. Remove vertical borders; set header fill #EEF1F6, bold header text.
3. Insert → Icons → relevant risk symbols; recolour as per severity; position in Risk cells.
4. Mitigant cells: Insert → Icons → tick in green; position top-right in each cell.
5. Format Impact cells: bold numbers, keep other text normal weight.
6. Draw bottom strip rectangle; Accent Blue fill, white text; place context bullets inside.

---

If you want, I can give you a **ready-to-drop-in table master** with the icons, severity dots, and ticks already formatted — so you just paste in the risk wording and numbers. That keeps this slide looking consistent with your prior ones and avoids fiddly alignment. Would you like me to prep that?

### **Slide 10: Why Mizuho Wins**

**Headline:** “Disciplined, priced, and underwritten — the ‘A-’ plan only Mizuho can deliver”

**1. The Three Pillars**
*   **Balance sheet commitment:** Sole-underwritten €12bn bridge + rights-issue backstop shows real risk appetite.
*   **Integrated platform:** LCM → DCM → ECM → DRSE → SFS executed as one choreography.
*   **Rating preservation:** Architecture built backwards from S&P/Moody’s triggers — the Board’s top priority.

**2. Client Value ↔ Mizuho Gain**

| What We Deliver | Client Value | Mizuho Gain |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| €12bn sole-underwritten bridge | Day-1 signing certainty | Lead-left control, arranger fees, early documentation primacy |
| Deal-contingent €11.3bn FX hedge | Fixes purchase FX with zero break cost | FX/derivatives P&L, CFO-level trust |
| €9bn multi-tranche Eurobond | Smooth refinancing ladder | DCM fees across 3 benchmarks, curve-shaping |
| €3bn equity path (ABB + rights pivot) | Speed + certainty under all markets | ECM lead-left fees, underwriting credentials |
| €1.5bn receivables SFS upsize | Cheaper funding, accelerates deleveraging | SFS arrangement + admin fees |

**3. Pipeline This Unlocks**
*   **Debt:** 3× EUR benchmarks + taps, RCF upsizing, hybrid potential
*   **Equity / equity-linked:** ABB now, rights if needed, later buybacks/blocks/convertibles
*   **Derivatives:** XCCY swaps, IRS, forwards, optionality for next M&A
*   **SFS / working capital:** Receivables programmes, SCF rollouts
*   **Treasury services:** Pooling, in-house bank, payments optimisation

**4. Economics & Franchise**
*   **Fees now:** Multi-product pool from bridge, DCM, ECM, SFS
*   **Run-rate annuity:** FX/IR hedging, SFS admin, cash management
*   **Risk:** Time-boxed bridge exposure, pre-placed syndication, off-balance-sheet SFS
*   **Franchise lift:** IG transport/logistics flagship → case study for next acquirer

**Closing Statement**
> *"We bring a disciplined, priced, and fully underwritten path that preserves ‘A-’ and DSV’s firepower. Multi-product, high-RAROC, and franchise-defining — we must lead this."*

Here’s how I’d turn Slide 10 into a “closing pitch” page that feels like the confident summary of an IB deck — structured, compact, and visually reinforcing that Mizuho is the only shop that can deliver the whole package.

---

## **Slide objective**

Close strong: remind them of the differentiated solution, show tangible client value, demonstrate cross-product integration, and end on a clear “we must lead” call.

---

## **Layout grid**

* **16:9**, 12-column grid, 0.6" margins, 0.25" gutters.
* Regions:

  1. Title bar (full width, 0.9")
  2. Top row (cols 1–12): “Three Pillars” horizontal panel
  3. Mid row (cols 1–12): Client Value ↔ Mizuho Gain table
  4. Lower row split (cols 1–6): Pipeline list, (cols 7–12): Economics & Franchise list
  5. Bottom banner (full width, 0.9"): Closing statement

---

## **Typography & colours**

* Font: Calibri; Title 30 pt; section labels 14 pt ALL CAPS; table 11–12 pt; bullets 12 pt.
* Colours: Navy #0B2447, Steel Grey #4A4A4A, Accent Blue #1B5DBF, Compliance Green #1E9E62, Light Grey #F2F4F7.
* Accent icons in Green for “delivery” and Navy for “value/gain”.

---

## **Build step-by-step**

### 1) Title bar

* Text: **“Disciplined, priced, and underwritten — the ‘A-’ plan only Mizuho can deliver”**
* 30 pt Navy bold; thin Navy underline.

---

### 2) Top row — The Three Pillars

* Horizontal 3-panel layout (equal width panels, 8 pt rounded corners, white fill, 0.5 pt outline #E6E8EC, 12 pt padding).
* Each panel has:

  * Small icon (e.g., balance sheet = bank building, integration = flow arrows, rating = shield with “A-”) in Compliance Green.
  * Short bold heading (“Balance sheet commitment”, “Integrated platform”, “Rating preservation”).
  * 1–2 lines of concise explanation (≤80 characters).

---

### 3) Mid row — Client Value ↔ Mizuho Gain table

* Label chip above table: “DELIVERABLES ↔ VALUE”.
* Table format: 3 columns — “What We Deliver” | “Client Value” | “Mizuho Gain”.
* Header fill #EEF1F6, bold white text on Navy or dark grey.
* Left column = product/service; middle column = benefit to DSV; right column = commercial benefit to Mizuho.
* Bold key transaction amounts (€12bn, €11.3bn, €9bn, €3bn, €1.5bn) for scanability.
* Keep each cell to 1 line if possible.

---

### 4) Lower row — Split lists

* **Left (Pipeline This Unlocks):**

  * Label chip: “PIPELINE POTENTIAL” (white on Accent Blue).
  * Bullets grouped by product type (Debt / Equity / Derivatives / SFS / Treasury).
  * Use subtle icons per category (bond, stock, swap, invoice, cash vault).
* **Right (Economics & Franchise):**

  * Label chip: “ECONOMICS & FRANCHISE”.
  * Bullets grouped by Fees now / Run-rate annuity / Risk / Franchise lift.
  * Bold category names at start of each bullet.

---

### 5) Bottom banner — Closing statement

* Full-width Accent Blue rectangle, white italic text:
  *“We bring a disciplined, priced, and fully underwritten path that preserves ‘A-’ and DSV’s firepower. Multi-product, high-RAROC, and franchise-defining — we must lead this.”*

---

## **Visual & micro-cues**

* Keep amounts in € and % in bold for immediate visibility.
* In the “Three Pillars”, align icon + heading consistently; icons \~18–20 px.
* Table: left-align text in first two columns, right-align fees if you add them in the last.
* Use consistent vertical rhythm: each section starts at the same height relative to the grid.
* Avoid overstuffing: white space = confidence.

---

## **PowerPoint click-path**

1. Copy slide master/theme from prior slides.
2. Insert → Shapes → Rounded Rectangles for Three Pillars; align horizontally.
3. Insert → Table for Value/Gain; format header fill #EEF1F6.
4. Create two rounded rectangles for lower split lists; add label chips.
5. Insert icons from PPT’s library; recolour Green or Navy.
6. Bottom banner: full-width rounded rectangle, Accent Blue fill, white italic text.

---

If you want, I can also map the *same icon/colour coding* used in prior slides (shield for rating, arrow flow for integration, bank building for funding) so the whole deck has a consistent visual language — that really makes the closing slide feel “tied together.” Would you like me to do that?
