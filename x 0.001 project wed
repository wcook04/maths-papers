SLIDE 1:

EMPTY AS OF NOW. 
Here’s how I’d structure your **Slide 1** so it hits hard, reads in under 10 seconds, and sets up the rest of the deck with authority.

---

## **Slide Title:**

**Project Goliath — Creating the New Global Logistics Leader**

---

### **Top Bar Headline:**

**€41.6bn revenue • #2 global 3PL • €1.2bn synergy target**

---

### **Left Panel — The Acquirer: DSV** *(credibility to execute)*

**Proven Integrator — Three Major Deals, Three Outperformances**

* **UTi (2016):** +DKK 1.2bn EBIT; Air & Sea EBIT +53% in Year 1.
* **Panalpina (2019):** Synergies +36% above plan; S\&P upgrade to A-.
* **Agility GIL (2021):** 75% of revenue onboarded in 6 months; +48% Group EBIT FY22.
  **Financial Discipline:** Pre-deal leverage 1.9×; A-/A3 ratings preserved via €10bn balanced equity/debt raise.

---

### **Right Panel — The Target: Schenker** *(strategic fit)*

**Scale:** €19.2bn revenue; #5 global 3PL; 1.33m tonnes air, 1.74m TEUs sea.
**Network Strength:** Unmatched European land freight — 430 branches, 400k daily shipments.
**Margin Gap:** 5.7% EBIT vs DSV’s 9.6% — 390bps = \~€750m EBIT uplift potential before synergies.

---

### **Bottom Strip — The Strategic Prize**

**Transformative fit:** DSV’s Air/Sea + Schenker’s European Land = true end-to-end global platform.
**Why now:** Motivated seller (DB deleveraging) + consolidating market + financing window secured.
**Value hinge:** Protecting the A- rating to keep cost of capital low and future M\&A firepower high.

---

**Visual suggestions:**

* Left: small **timeline bar** of UTi → Panalpina → GIL with synergy € figures above each.
* Right: **map** of Europe showing Schenker’s dense road network overlaid with DSV’s air/sea hubs.
* Bottom: one **combined revenue league table** showing the jump to #2 global 3PL.

---

If you want, I can also condense this into a **pure one-page visual** with almost no text so the presenter can tell the story — which would hit even harder.

SLIDE 2:
The Schenker Opportunity & Proven Playbook

This slide provides historical context on precedent acquisitions and the standalone Schenker opportunity. As per the update instructions, the content here remains unchanged as it reflects historical performance and the initial deal rationale, not the financing structure itself.

---

 Scale & Market Leadership
 €41.5bn pro-forma revenue; top-tier global forwarder
 ~7% global 3PL share → stronger procurement & capacity access
 Larger wallet share with top-100 clients; cross-sell across Air/Sea/Land

---

 Network Fit
DSV — Air & Sea engine (~58% of rev)
Schenker — dense European Land/Road network
Result — true end-to-end multimodal platform; managed flows of ~2.4m tonnes air and ~4.3m TEUs sea p.a.; single IT stack for yield & routing

---

 Market Uplift Potential
EBIT margin (%)
 DSV: ~10.6
 DB Schenker: ~5.5
 Target (Year 3): ~8–9

Levers: IT consolidation • network & lane optimisation • procurement • SG&A/ops model discipline
Prize: €1.0bn+ run-rate synergy in ~3 years; step-up in ROCE

---
Got it — here’s your replacement for the Synergy Waterfall that’s just as concise as the original, keeps the same “at-a-glance” footprint, but is built entirely on precedent-backed levers drawn from UTi, Panalpina, and Agility GIL.

---

 Operational Value Creation – Proven DSV Playbook

| Lever                                        | Precedent Proof                                      | Strategic Impact                               |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Rapid IT & Network Integration           | UTi → 60% network merged & core TMS migration in <6m | Immediate efficiency gains, minimal disruption |
| Margin Uplift via Operational Discipline | Panalpina → conversion ratio +5pp in 18m             | Aligns Schenker margins toward DSV benchmark   |
| Scale-Driven Procurement & Cross-Sell    | GIL → enhanced buy-rate power & APAC/ME client wins  | Lower unit cost, higher GP/Shipment            |

---

This keeps three consolidated levers (instead of six) so it’s as tight as the old waterfall, but every line is grounded in a real, named precedent.

If you want, I can now drop this straight into Slide 1 so it reads seamlessly with your “Proven Playbook” narrative and keeps the tight slide density you already have.

 Bottom Insight Strip
“The industrial logic is clear; value only accrues if the financing architecture protects the ‘A-’ rating and preserves firepower for the next acquisition.”

SLIDE 3:

Task 2
Table of information:
Slide 3 comparable companies that had a downgrade when they tried to pursue an acquisition and the negatives that happened with regards to specifically their ability to then finance themselves later. Top 3 cases of direct comparable. Full details of what capital raise they did and their misstep. This will need to be condensed down into a 5 row table with 3 columns.
Max like a sentence per cell.



| Company & Year     | Misstep Leading to Downgrade                                                                       | Impact on Future Financing                                                           |

SLIDE 4 
Phase 1 - Deal Mechanics & Bridge Facility

This slide outlines the initial execution steps. The core mechanics of the bridge and FX hedging remain the same, but the permanent "Take-out" plan has been updated to reflect the new, phased approach designed to secure the 'A-' rating.

---

 Execution Timeline & Mechanics



T0 — Signing
 Funding Locked: €12bn bridge facility is committed but undrawn.
 FX Locked: Deal-contingent Sell DKK / Buy EUR forward is executed to fix the acquisition cost.
 Fees: Upfront fees paid; ticking fee commences from Day+60.

T0→T1 — Pre-close (~9 months)
 No settlement occurs. Only cost is the ticking fee on the undrawn bridge.

T1 — Close
 The €12bn bridge facility is drawn to pay the seller and settle the deal-contingent forward, securing the locked-in EUR purchase price.

T2/T3 — Take-out (Phased, post-close)
 (UPDATED) The bridge is refinanced via a multi-step process designed to maintain the 'A-' rating:
     Immediate: €3.0bn equity from an Accelerated Bookbuild (ABB) at close.
     T+6-8 weeks: €1.5-2.0bn of fast, low-cost liquidity via Securitisation (SFS).
     T+3-4 months: Optional €1.5-2.0bn top-up ABB for further deleveraging.
     T+9-12 months: €4bn in EUR bonds issued once the market sees post-deal earnings.

If deal fails:
 The deal-contingent forward lapses at zero cost. The bridge is never drawn. Only sunk costs are the upfront/ticking fees.

---

 Card Refinements

Left Card — Bridge Facility
 Purpose: Day-1 funding certainty via a sole-underwritten bridge-to-permanent capital.
 Economics: Margin (A-) +100/+150/+200 bps; ticking from D+60; extension ~25 bps per 6m; max life 24m.
 Docs: Minimal CPs; pre-aligned with the phased take-out structure (SFS, Equity, Bonds).

Right Card — Deal-Contingent EUR/DKK Forward
 Why this: Zero break cost if the deal fails; no upfront premium.
 Tenor: Signing → expected close (~9m).
 Takeaway: “FX cost of the purchase is fixed at signing; settlement only if the deal completes.”

Alright — here’s the fully reworked Slide 4 – Phase 2: Permanent Capital (Equity) with all the existing strong content kept, your new refinements integrated, and the ABB vs. Rights Issue trade-off + bottom-third leverage relief plot added.
awesome — here’s a tight, do-it-by-hand **PowerPoint object & arrow guide** that mirrors the algorithm you liked, but in PPT terms. No code, just exactly what to draw, in what order, where to put it, and how to wire it up.

# 1) Slide setup (once)

* **Slide size:** 16:9 (default).
* **Turn on:** View → **Guides** & **Gridlines**; **Snap to Grid** on.
* **Grid spacing:** 0.25 cm (or 0.1" if you’re imperial).
* **Working margins:** eyeball \~1 cm left/right, \~1 cm bottom, and \~1.4 cm top for the title.

# 2) Create swimlanes (background)

Make four full-width rectangles (light fills, no border), stacked top→bottom:

1. **Buyer (DSV)**
2. **Hedge Bank (FX/DCF)**
3. **Bridge Banks**
4. **Seller**

* Use **Align → Distribute Vertically** so all lanes are equal height.
* Put lane labels at the **left edge** (bold, small caps). Send lanes **to back**.

# 3) Add column guides (timeline)

Add three **vertical guides** to anchor columns (rough positions on a 33.9×19.1 cm slide):

* **T0 Signing** center ≈ **7.7 cm** from left
* **Pre-close (\~9m)** center ≈ **14.4 cm**
* **T1 Close** center ≈ **21.2 cm**
  Add a fourth guide at ≈ **28.0 cm** to reserve a **right margin** for callouts/legend.

# 4) Object inventory (what to draw & where)

Use **Rounded Rectangle** for process boxes (≈ **6.2 × 1.2 cm** unless noted). Put each box centred on its column guide, in the lane specified.

### T0 — Signing (left column)

**Buyer lane**

* **A2**: “Execute DCF: Sell DKK / Buy EUR (contingent on Completion)” — place slightly **above** lane centre.
* **A1**: “Sign SPA” — **below** A2 with \~0.4 cm gap.
* **A3** (small note ≈ 4.0×0.8 cm): “Hedge rate locked: K\_EURDKK” — **above** A2 by \~0.4 cm.

**Bridge lane**

* **B1**: “€12bn Bridge committed (undrawn). Upfront fees; ticking from D+60.”

### Pre-close (middle column)

**Buyer lane**

* **A4**: “No settlement; only ticking on undrawn bridge.”

**Bridge lane**

* **B2** (same size but **50% transparency**): “Facility available; undrawn.”

**Decision (between Buyer & Hedge lanes)**

* **F0** (Diamond ≈ 1.4×1.4 cm), centred **just to the right** of the Pre-close guide (about halfway to T1): text “Completion?”

### T1 — Close (right column)

**Buyer lane**

* **A5**: “Funds received in EUR (bridge draw).”

**Bridge lane**

* **B3**: “Draw €12bn Bridge.” Place **\~2 cm left** of the T1 guide (so the cash arrow reaches up/over neatly).

**Hedge lane (right of A5)**

* **C1**: “DCF settlement @ K (physical or cash).” Place **\~2 cm right** of the T1 guide.

**Seller lane (far right of T1 cluster)**

* **D1**: “Close & transfer assets.” Place **\~3 cm right** of the T1 guide.

### Failure branch (off F0, to the right)

* **F1** (Hedge lane, a bit **below** F0): “DCF lapses automatically — no cost.” Add a small **red X** overlay (two thin lines forming a cross) on this box.
* **F2** (Bridge lane, level with lane centre): “Bridge never drawn.”
* **F3** (Buyer lane, a bit **above** F0): “Only sunk costs: upfront + ticking.”

### Title, notes, legend

* **Title** (top): “Deal-Contingent EUR/DKK Forward — How It Works”.
* **Legal notes** (3 × **Rectangular Callout** ≈ 5×1.2 cm) in the **right margin**, vertically stacked:

  1. “Settlement window aligned to funding cut-offs.”
  2. “Notify bank on SPA amendments (keep contingent nexus).”
  3. “Phoenix clause: look-back true-up if equivalent deal closes within X months.”
* **Maths callout** (bottom, under T1 cluster): small callout:

  * “ΔS = S\_T1 − S\_T0”
  * “DCF P/L ≈ −ΔS on notional”
  * “Effective DKK cost ≈ EUR price × K (+ fees)”
* **Legend** (bottom-right, small):

  * 4 short line samples with labels: **Solid** “Cash/commitments”; **Dashed** “Hedge/derivative”; **Dotted** “Contingent”; **Red X** “Automatic lapse”.

# 5) Draw the connectors (the important bit)

Use **Insert → Shapes → Connector: Elbow** (right-angle). After drawing each, set **Shape Outline** style:

* **Cash/commitments (solid):** 2.25 pt, arrowhead **Triangle** at the end.
* **Hedge (dashed):** 2.0 pt, **short dash** pattern, arrowheads both ends **if** you want bidirectional look; otherwise two parallel one-way arrows with tiny vertical offset.
* **Contingent (dotted):** 2.0 pt, **round dots**, triangle arrowheads.

### Route each connector like this

1. **B3 → A5 (cash draw)**

   * Start from **B3 top** edge; go **up** into the “channel” between Bridge & Hedge lanes; then **across** to above **A5**; drop **down** into **A5** (hit its **top edge**).
   * Label (small textbox) “€12bn draw”. Place on the long **horizontal** segment; **Group** label with the line.

2. **A5 → D1 (purchase price)**

   * From **A5 bottom** edge, drop into the channel between Buyer & Bridge, go **right**, then up into **D1 top** edge.
   * Label: “EUR purchase price”.

3. **A5 ⇄ C1 (DCF settlement @ K)**

   * Place **two short horizontal connectors** between **A5 right** edge and **C1 left** edge. Offset one by \~0.2 cm **up** and the other **down** so the arrowheads don’t overlap.
   * Style both **dashed**, add labels: “deliver DKK” (upper), “receive EUR / or cash P/L” (lower).
   * If you prefer one object, use a **double-arrow** dashed line centred between the boxes and a single label “Settle DCF @ K (only if Completion)”.

4. **F0 → F1 / F2 / F3 (contingent outcomes)**

   * Three **dotted** connectors fanning out:

     * **F0 → F1**: angle slightly **down-right** into Hedge lane.
     * **F0 → F2**: mostly **right** into Bridge lane.
     * **F0 → F3**: angle **up-right** into Buyer lane.
   * No labels needed (text is in boxes).

5. (Optional) **A2 → A5** faint guidance arrow (no arrowhead, 1 pt light grey) to suggest lifecycle, but keep it subtle or omit to avoid clutter.

# 6) Styling & hierarchy (so it reads at a glance)

* **Boxes:** white fill, 0.75 pt outline; key boxes (**A5, C1, B3, D1**) bold titles.
* **Lane labels:** small caps; 70% grey.
* **Z-order:** Boxes on top; then **solid** lines; then **dashed**; then **dotted**; the **red X** overlay sits on top of **F1**.
* **Colour discipline:** Keep most things neutral; if you add colour, use it only for:

  * **Hedge** arrows (subtle blue/grey),
  * **Failure** X (red),
  * **Decision** F0 (amber outline).

# 7) Alignment & distribution (quick clean-up)

* Select all boxes in each **column** → **Align Center** (relative to the column guide).
* Select the three main columns’ **hub boxes** (A2, A4, A5) → **Distribute Horizontally**.
* Within each **lane**, select its boxes → **Distribute Vertically** with \~0.4 cm spacing.
* For labels on lines, **Group** label + line so they move together.

# 8) Naming & selection hygiene (saves time)

* Open **Selection Pane** and rename shapes with IDs: A1, A2, A3, B1, … D1, F0, F1–F3.
* Group logical clusters:

  * **T0 cluster** (A1–A3, B1)
  * **Pre-close cluster** (A4, B2, F0)
  * **T1 cluster** (A5, B3, C1, D1)
  * **Failure branch** (F1–F3 + dotted lines)
  * **Legend** and **Callouts**

# 9) Micro-tweaks to guarantee readability

* Keep **A5** roughly **horizontally between** B3 (left-ish) and C1 (right-ish) so both connectors are short and clean.
* Ensure **A5 → D1** doesn’t overlap the B3→A5 path; if it does, nudge **D1** a bit further right.
* If the two dashed settlement arrows visually collide, raise **C1** by \~0.2–0.3 cm.

---

## Quick checklist (so you know you’re done)

* [ ] Four swimlanes labelled; three timeline columns visible.
* [ ] T0: A2 above A1; A3 small note above A2; B1 present.
* [ ] Pre-close: A4 and faint B2; F0 diamond to the right of the column centre.
* [ ] T1: B3 left, **A5 centre**, C1 right, D1 far right.
* [ ] Failure branch: F1 (with red X), F2, F3 to the right of F0 with dotted connectors fanning out.
* [ ] Solid cash lines (B3→A5, A5→D1), dashed hedge line(s) (A5⇄C1), dotted contingency lines (F0→F1/F2/F3).
* [ ] Maths callout under T1; three legal callouts in right margin; legend bottom-right.

If you want a one-page printable “stencil” (with the shapes pre-sized and named) I can spit out a PPTX you can duplicate across slides.

 Slide 5: Phase 2 – Permanent Capital (Equity)

Perfect—here’s the **rights-issue slide, corrected and with the maths shown clearly** so anyone can see exactly how we got the numbers. I kept your structure and copy, and added a compact derivation block + sensitivity so you can drop it straight in.

---

# Slide 4: Phase 2 – Permanent Capital (Equity)

## Execution Decision (UPDATED)

Proceed with a **fully underwritten €6.0bn Rights Issue** (pre-emptive). Keep an **ABB pivot** only if the RI window is impaired (vol/illiquidity/timetable).

---

## Execution Metrics & Decision Framework

### Path A — Rights Issue (Primary)

* **Target size:** **€6.0bn** (**DKK 44.76bn**).
* **Central case terms (illustrative, mathematically consistent):**

  * **Pre-launch baseline:** **N₀ = 214.0m** shares, **P₀ = DKK 1,415** → **Mkt cap = DKK 302.81bn**.
  * **Discount to TERP (d):** **33.0%** (in line with 2024 large-cap RI precedents).
  * **Solved values (see “How we got here” below):**

    * **Subscription price (Pₛ):** **DKK 878.5**
    * **New shares (N₁):** **50.95m**
    * **Rights ratio:** **≈ 1-for-4.20** → use clean **5-for-21**
    * **TERP:** **DKK 1,311.8**
    * **Dilution:** **N₁/N₀ = 23.8%** (of pre-cap) = **19.2%** of enlarged
    * **Pro forma shares:** **264.95m**
    * **Pro forma market cap (at TERP):** **DKK 347.57bn** (= 302.81 + 44.76)
* **Timing:** Prospectus, rights trading & subscription **\~3–4 weeks**; **T+2 days** settlement.
* **Underwriting:** **Fully underwritten**; typical **2.0–3.0%** all-in fee for large EU RIs.
* **Message:** **Fairness + certainty** for a transformational deal; **rating protection** on settlement.

### Path B — ABB (Pivot)

Use only if **30d vol > \~25%**, rights market dislocation, or timetable constraints.

* **Pros:** **Cash in hours**, negligible overhang.
* **Cons:** **Non-pre-emptive**, sizing subject to AGM headroom.

## Rights Issue — Pros & Cons (vs ABB)

| Criteria       | **Rights Issue (Primary)**                        | **ABB (Pivot)**                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Speed**      | \~3–4 weeks to cash                               | **Hours** to cash                    |
| **Certainty**  | **Fully underwritten**, but exposed to a window   | High once launched; minimal window   |
| **Cost/Disc.** | **Deeper discount to TERP (\~30–35%)**; fees 2–3% | **Tighter discount**; fees \~1.5–2%  |
| **Dilution**   | **Pre-emptive** (fair to all holders)             | **Non-pre-emptive**                  |
| **Execution**  | Robust if discount adequate                       | Sensitive to tape on the night       |
| **Signal**     | Inclusive, balance-sheet prudence                 | Decisive, curated investor base      |
| **Our Choice** | **Primary** (fairness + proceeds certainty)       | **Pivot** (speed if RI window shuts) |

## Bottom-Third Visual: Leverage Relief — **Timing Matters**

**Chart spec:** Two paths — **Rights Issue (solid)** as chosen path; **ABB (dashed)** as actual 2024 context.

* **X-axis:** Months from Close (0, 1, 3, 6, 12)
* **Y-axis:** Net Debt / EBITDA (turns)
* **Dashed line:** **2.0× policy ceiling**

**Illustrative points for plotting (consistent with your deck style):**

| Event/Timing                         | **Rights Issue (Chosen)** | **ABB (Actual, context)** |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------: | ------------------------: |
| Close (T0)                           |                      3.0× |                      3.0× |
| **T+1 month (RI settled)**           |                  **2.2×** |                         — |
| T+3 months (SFS / early synergies)   |                      2.0× |                      2.1× |
| T+6 months (select bonds refinanced) |                      1.9× |                      1.9× |
| Year 1 (run-rate post-bonds)         |                      1.8× |                      1.8× |

**Annotations:**

* At **T+1m** on RI path: “**–0.8× relief on settlement**”.
* **Shaded T0–T+1m**: “**Delayed equity impact — rating headroom at risk**”.
* On ABB dashed at **T+0**: “**Immediate –0.6× relief (actual 2024 ABB)**”.

## Rights Issue — Technical Flow (small bottom-left box)

1. **EGM authority** & **prospectus** cleared; wall-cross top holders on intent.
2. **Announce terms** (ratio, Pₛ, full underwriting).
3. **Ex-rights**; **nil-paid rights trade \~10 business days**.
4. **Subscription \~10 business days**; place rump if any.
5. **T+2 settlement** → **immediate debt repayment**.

---

## Key Takeaway

The **Rights Issue–first** approach **maximises fairness and certainty of full proceeds** for Schenker. Deleveraging lands on **settlement (\~T+1m)** rather than T+0, but the **fully underwritten, pre-emptive** structure protects the rating and aligns all shareholders in funding the transformation.

---

## How we got the numbers (clear derivation)

**Inputs (baseline before the raise):**

* **Shares (N₀):** 214.0m
* **Share price (P₀):** DKK 1,415
* **Target gross proceeds:** **DKK 44.76bn** (€6.0bn @ 7.46)

**Definitions & identities:**

* **Discount to TERP:** $d$ (e.g., 33%)
* **Subscription price:** $P_s = \text{TERP}\,(1-d)$
* **Gross proceeds:** $\text{Gross} = P_s \, N_1$
* **TERP:** $\text{TERP} = \dfrac{N_0 P_0 + \text{Gross}}{N_0 + N_1}$

Solve for **new shares** $N_1$ given a target discount to TERP $d$:

$$
N_1 \;=\; \frac{\text{Gross}\,N_0}{N_0 P_0 (1-d) - \text{Gross}\,d}
$$

Then compute **TERP** and **Pₛ** from the identities above.

### Central case (33% discount to TERP)

* $d = 0.33$ →

  * **$N_1 = 50.92m$**
  * **TERP = DKK 1,311.98**
  * **$P_s = DKK 879.03$**
  * **Rights ratio ≈ 1-for-4.20 → use clean 5-for-21**
  * **Check:** $P_s \times N_1 = 44.76\text{bn}$

**Clean ratio (exact 5-for-21) version:**

* $N_1 = N_0 \times \tfrac{5}{21} = 50.95m$
* $P_s = \dfrac{44.76\text{bn}}{50.95m} = \mathbf{DKK\ 878.47}$
* TERP = **DKK 1,311.82**, **discount to TERP = 33.03%** (almost identical to target)

## Sensitivity — discount to TERP (keeps gross fixed at DKK 44.76bn)

| **Discount to TERP** | **Pₛ (DKK)** | **TERP (DKK)** | **New shares (m)** | **Rights ratio (≈1-for-X)** | **New as % pre** | **New as % enlarged** | **Pro forma shares (m)** | **Pro forma mkt cap (DKK bn)** |

> Note: **Pro forma market cap at TERP = pre-deal market cap + gross proceeds** (fees ignored for simplicity).

### Clean, “nice” ratios you can use at launch (and their implied discounts)

*(All keep gross at DKK 44.76bn by adjusting Pₛ accordingly.)*

| **Clean ratio** | **Implied 1-for-X** | **New shares (m)** | **Pₛ (DKK)** | **TERP (DKK)** | **Implied disc. to TERP** |
| --------------- | ------------------: | -----------------: | -----------: | -------------: | ------------------------: |
| **5-for-24**    |                4.80 |              44.58 |      1,004.0 |        1,344.1 |                 **25.3%** |
| **7-for-31**    |                4.43 |              48.32 |        926.3 |        1,325.0 |                 **30.1%** |
| **5-for-22**    |                4.40 |              48.64 |        920.3 |        1,323.4 |                 **30.5%** |
| **5-for-21**    |                4.20 |              50.95 |    **878.5** |    **1,311.8** |                 **33.0%** |
| **1-for-4**     |                4.00 |              53.50 |        836.6 |        1,299.3 |                 **35.6%** |

*(Pick the ratio you like, then set Pₛ to hit €6bn; the implied discount to TERP follows mechanically.)*

### Quick validation checks (central case)

* **Gross = Pₛ × N₁ = 878.5 × 50.95m ≈ DKK 44.76bn (OK)**
* **TERP = (N₀P₀ + Gross)/(N₀+N₁) = (214m×1,415 + 44.76bn)/264.95m ≈ DKK 1,311.8 (OK)**
* **Discount to TERP = 1 − Pₛ/TERP = 1 − 878.5/1,311.8 ≈ 33.0% (OK)**
* **Pro forma mkt cap = TERP × (N₀+N₁) ≈ 347.57bn = 302.81 + 44.76 (OK)**

NEXT SLIDE


Phase 2 – Permanent Capital (Debt)
Awesome—here’s a clean, “drop-in” rewrite that keeps your slide’s structure but replaces the grey block with evidence-backed justification. I’ve used your comps (DSV, Siemens, Deutsche Post, Volvo, Daimler Truck) and your tenor logic (3y/5y/7y) so everything ties back to recent EUR IG precedent.

# Phase 2 – Permanent Capital (Debt)

**Sub-title (updated):**
€4bn EUR bond issue in Year 1 to complete bridge take-out after initial deleveraging via equity and SFS.

**Top-right pill (small):**
*A- vs BBB: avoid +35–40 bps “BBB uplift”*
Maintaining A- preserves the tighter A-investor universe and materially lowers funding cost.

---

## Left card — Structure & Tenor (updated)

* **Purpose**
  Final permanent capital to refinance the bridge from a position of strength (9–12 months post close/integration progress).

* **Format**
  **€4bn Reg S via EMTN** — fastest docs, deep EMEA investor base, natural EUR liability for EUR assets; no 144A complexity needed.

* **Tenors & Sizes**
  **€2.5bn 5y (anchor)** — belly of curve maximises orderbook depth & price tension; mirrors recent blue-chip playbooks.
  **€1.0bn 3y (treasury pocket)** — taps bank treasuries/CBs/MMFs; strong, price-insensitive demand.
  **€0.5bn 7y (duration)** — efficient curve extension with smaller size to keep cover high and tighten pricing.
  *Option:* switch 7y to **3y FRN** if rates volatility/curve shifts favour floating.

* **Docs readiness**
  EMTN programme pre-cleared; terms aligned to prior usage; execution-ready for windowed launch.

* **Macro (live line)**
  EUR IG supply light; ECB easing backdrop; IG fund inflows strong; **NICs \~0–5 bps** for strategic A- issuers; i-spreads tightening MTD.

## Right panel replacement — “Why these tranches?” (evidence-based)

| Tranche |       Size | Target investors                           | Key precedents (tenor / size)                                     | Indicative pricing corridor\* | Why it works                                                                |

| **5y**  | **€2.5bn** | Core AMs/insurers/pensions (belly)         | DSV **4y** (MS+55) & **6y** (MS+70); Siemens **4y**; Volvo **5y** | **MS+60–70 bps**              | Anchor tranche maximises cover and tightening; sets liquid on-the-run line. |
| **7y**  | **€0.5bn** | Duration-seeking AMs                       | DSV **8y** (MS+85); Deutsche Post **7y** (\~3.19% yld)            | **MS+75–85 bps**              | Efficient curve extension with smaller size to maintain pricing power.      |

\*Pricing corridors derived from the comps you collected; final landing points subject to secondary curve at launch and live IPT feedback.

| **DSV**               | Nov-24 | Fixed   |     1,000 |    4y | **MS+55**; very large books, minimal NIC.         |
| **DSV**               | Nov-24 | Fixed   |     1,250 |    6y | **MS+70**; anchor tranche, peak demand.           |
| **DSV**               | Nov-24 | Fixed   |         — |    8y | **MS+85**; successful duration add.               |
| **DSV**               | Jun-24 | Fixed   |       500 |    5y | 3.50% cpn (EMTN).                                 |
| **Siemens**           | May-25 | Fixed   |     1,000 |    4y | \~2.665% re-offer; part of €4bn multi-tranche.    |
| **Siemens**           | May-25 | Fixed   |       500 |    8y | \~3.218% re-offer; multi-tranche anchor in belly. |

*(Use 6–8 of these rows on the slide to keep it clean; the rest can sit in an appendix.)*

---

## Execution notes (concise, replaces “Syndication & Investors” bullets)

* **Syndication**: Lead-left Mizuho DCM; pre-sound 30–40 anchors; **IPTs**: MS+ \~70/60/80 (7/5/3y order to shape books), tighten 10–15 bps on ≥3× cover.
* **Allocation**: ≥70% long-only; PB/banks supportive on 3y; geography skew EMEA with Asia support in 5y/7y.
* **Outcome targets**: **NIC 0–5 bps**, final spreads inside IPTs, 5y priced on/through DSV curve; 3y FRN toggle if rates volatility spikes.

---

### What to say if asked “why not a 10-year now?”

* 10y depth is thinner vs 5–7y for A- industrials in current backdrop; paying an extra \~10–15 bps for size is inefficient today.
* Keep 10y as **follow-on** post-results/next window once the new 5y line trades liquid and tight.

---

## (Optional appendix content for your deck)

**Research checklist you can cite in Q\&A**

1. Recent A- EUR IG comps (logistics/industrial) — tenors, MS spreads, cover, NIC.
2. Secondary curve for DSV & peers (5y as pivot) — fair-value vs landing point.
3. Investor feedback memos — belly preference and 3y treasury demand notes.
4. EMTN workflow timeline — show “docs ready” speed vs 144A.
5. A- vs BBB cost gap — show recent BBB logistics prints (+100–140 bps vs A- belly) to reinforce rating strategy.

Got it — here’s a **TikZ blueprint** (no code) you can hand-translate straight into LaTeX. It lays out lanes, columns, node IDs, connectors, labels, and a small legend for a **dual-tranche bridge-to-bond** with the DCF hedge and phased take-out.

# Canvas & Grid

* **Page:** landscape A4 (or beamer 16:9).
* **X (timeline columns):** `x0` (Signing), `x1` (Pre-close), `x2` (Close), `x3` (T+6–8w SFS), `x4` (T+3–4m Equity), `x5` (T+9–12m Bonds).
* **Y (swimlanes top→bottom):** `yB` Buyer (DSV), `yH` Hedge Bank (DCF), `yG` Bridge Banks, `yS` Seller, `yC` Capital Markets (take-out).

# Swimlanes (light fills, no border labels on left)

* `L1` Buyer, `L2` Hedge, `L3` Bridge Banks, `L4` Seller, `L5` Capital Mkts (optional; or place take-out above lanes as a band).

# Node Styles (names only; implement later)

* **process** (rounded rectangle), **decision** (diamond), **callout** (small rectangle), **band** (thin timeline strip).
* Line styles: **solid** (cash/commitments), **dashed** (hedge), **dotted** (contingent), **thick** (take-out prepayments).

# Nodes (with IDs, lane, column, label)

**Signing (x0)**

* `A1` @ (x0, yB): “Sign SPA”.
* `A2` @ (x0, yH): “Execute DCF: Sell DKK / Buy EUR (contingent)”.
* `B1a` @ (x0, yG): “Commit **Bridge A €6bn** (undrawn) — Upfront 15bps; ticking grid”.
* `B1b` @ (x0, yG, below B1a): “Commit **Bridge B €6bn** (undrawn) — same terms”.

**Pre-close (x1)**

* `B2` @ (x1, yG): “Undrawn; ticking accrues per grid”.
* `D0` (decision) @ (mid between x1 and x2, between yB & yH): “Completion?”.

**Close (x2)**

* `A3` @ (x2, yG): “Draw Bridge A/B”.
* `A4` @ (x2, yB): “Receive funds (EUR)”.
* `H1` @ (x2, yH): “Settle DCF @ K (only if Completion)”.
* `S1` @ (x2, yS): “Close & transfer assets”.

**Failure branch (from D0)**

* `F1` @ (x2, yH, slightly below): “DCF lapses automatically — no cost”.
* `F2` @ (x2, yG): “Bridge not drawn”.
* `F3` @ (x2, yB, slightly above): “Only sunk: upfront + ticking”.

**Take-out (x3–x5)**

* `T1` @ (x3, yC): “SFS (securitisation) €1.5–2.0bn — pay down bridge”.
* `T2` @ (x4, yC): “Equity (RI/ABB) €3.0–6.0bn — mandatory prepay”.
* `T3` @ (x5, yC): “EUR Bonds €4bn — refinance remainder; repay bridge”.

**Fee band (optional, along bottom)**

* `Mband` (band) from x0→x5: “Margin step-ups: 0–3m 25 | 3–6m 30 | 7–9m 40 | 10–12m 50 | 13–15m 70 | 16–18m 80 | 19–21m 100 | 22–24m 120”.
* `Tband` (band) from x0→x2: “Ticking on undrawn: 0–2m 0% | 3–5m 10% | ≥6m 30%”.
* `Eband` (callout near x2/x3): “Extensions: +7.5bps / +10bps; max life 24m”.

**Waterfall note (small callout near yG, x3–x5)**

* `W1`: “Mandatory prepayment waterfall: Interest/fees → **Tranche A** → **Tranche B** (pro-rata allowed if agreed).”

# Connectors (what links to what, with labels)

**Core cash path**

* `B1a → A3` (solid): label “€6bn commit → draw at Close”.
* `B1b → A3` (solid): label “€6bn commit → draw at Close”.
* `A3 → A4` (solid): label “Bridge proceeds (EUR)”.
* `A4 → S1` (solid): label “Purchase price (EUR)”.

**Hedge**

* `A4 ⇄ H1` (dashed, double-arrow or two parallel): labels “deliver DKK” / “receive EUR (or cash P/L)”.

**Contingent failure**

* From `D0` to `F1`, `F2`, `F3` (dotted): no labels (text is in nodes).
* From `A2` to `H1` (dashed, dotted overlay via `D0`): add small tag “only if Completion”.

**Take-out prepayments (thick arrows)**

* `T1 → A3` (thick solid): label “SFS proceeds — prepay Bridge”.
* `T2 → A3` (thick solid): label “Equity proceeds — mandatory prepay”.
* `T3 → A3` (thick solid): label “Bond proceeds — refinance remainder”.

**Dual-tranche clarity (split arrows)**

* From each of `T1`, `T2`, `T3`, split to **A** and **B** sub-nodes:

  * Create small invisible anchors `A3a` and `A3b` (co-located with `A3`, offset left/right) labelled “Bridge A” and “Bridge B”.
  * Route `T* → A3a` and `T* → A3b` with identical lines; tiny labels “A” and “B” at arrowheads.

# Titles & Annotations

* Top title: “Bridge-to-Bond (Dual-Tranche) — Mechanism & Take-out”.
* Small subtitle near x0: “Committed at Signing, Undrawn Until Close”.
* Note near D0: “If No Completion: hedge lapses; bridge undrawn”.
* Note near x5: “Bridge fully repaid; permanent capital in place”.

# Legend (bottom-right mini box)

* Line samples:

  * Solid — “Cash/Commitments”
  * Dashed — “Hedge/Derivative”
  * Dotted — “Contingent (if Completion)”
  * Thick — “Take-out Prepayment”
* Shape samples:

  * Rounded rect — “Process”
  * Diamond — “Decision”

# Variants (choose one if you need a simpler figure)

1. **No-hedge version:** drop `yH`, `A2`, `H1`, dashed links; tighten vertical spacing.
2. **Compact take-out:** collapse `T1/T2/T3` into one node “Phased Take-out (SFS / Equity / Bonds)” with three small bullets inside.
3. **Fee focus:** keep only x0–x2 nodes and the `Mband/Tband/Eband` bands for a fees-timeline slide.

If you want, tell me which **variant** you’re using and I’ll turn this blueprint into clean TikZ next.

awesome — here’s your **PowerPoint build guide** for Slide 9. It mirrors the TikZ blueprint 1:1, but written as “what to draw, where to put it, and how to wire it up” in PowerPoint. No code — just precise steps, sizes, and routing so you can build it fast and clean.

---

# 0) Slide setup (once)

* **Size:** 16:9 (Widescreen).
* **Turn on:** View → **Guides** & **Gridlines**. Enable **Snap to Grid**.
* **Grid spacing:** 0.25 cm.
* **Working margins:** Left/Right **1.0 cm**, Top **1.4 cm** (title zone), Bottom **1.0 cm**.
* **Working area:** \~**31.9 × 16.6 cm** inside the margins on a standard 33.9 × 19.1 cm slide.

> Tip: Open **Selection Pane** (Home → Arrange → Selection Pane) and keep it open. We’ll name everything for easy edits.

---

# 1) Global guides (the “spine”)

Add **vertical guides** to anchor the timeline columns (distance from the **left slide edge**):

* **C0 Prep (T–X):** 2.2 cm
* **C1 Signing (T0):** 6.0 cm
* **C2 Pre-close (\~9m):** 9.8 cm
* **C3 Close (T1):** 13.6 cm
* **C4 RI (T+1m):** 17.4 cm
* **C5 SFS (T+6–8w):** 21.2 cm
* **C6 Bonds (T+9–12m):** 25.0 cm

Add a **top horizontal guide** at 2.2 cm (for the title line) and **lane top** at 3.2 cm.

---

# 2) Swimlanes (background bands)

Create **6** full-width rectangles (no border, very light fill), stacked with equal height (\~**2.2 cm** each), starting under the title zone:

1. **L1 Corporate Actions (DSV)**
2. **L2 Bridge Facility (A & B, €6bn each)**
3. **L3 FX Hedge (Deal-Contingent Fwd)**
4. **L4 ECM — Rights Issue**
5. **L5 SFS / Liquidity Ops**
6. **L6 DCM — EUR Bonds**

* Left-justify **lane labels** inside each band (bold small caps).
* **Send to Back** (behind all future shapes).
* **Name groups:** `Lane-L1` … `Lane-L6`.

---

# 3) Title, subtitle, spine dots (top bar)

* **Title (top-left):** “**End-to-End Deal Timeline — Rights Issue → SFS → Bonds**”.
* **Subtitle (small):** “Bridge committed at Signing; FX cost fixed; phased take-out preserves A- rating”.
* Add **milestone dots** (small filled circles, \~0.25 cm) centered on each column guide along a thin horizontal “spine” line. Label the dots above with the column names (T–X, T0, \~9m, T1, T+1m, T+6–8w, T+9–12m).

---

# 4) Object inventory (what to draw, where)

Use **Rounded Rectangle** for all process boxes. Default size **6.0 × 1.4 cm** (adjust to fit text). Centre each box **on its column guide** and **within its lane**.

### C0 — Prep (T–X)

* **N01** (L1): “Board approves acquisition & financing plan”
* **N02** (L1, below N01): “Mandate Bridge / ECM (RI) / DCM / FX”
* **N03** (L6): “EMTN ready; docs pre-cleared”
* **N04** (L3): “Scope DCF terms (EUR/DKK @ K)”

### C1 — Signing (T0)

* **N11** (L1): “Sign SPA”
* **N12** (L2): “Commit Bridge A €6bn + Bridge B €6bn (undrawn)”
* **N13** (L3): “Execute DCF: Sell DKK / Buy EUR (contingent)”
* **N14** (L2, **small tag** \~4.5 × 1.1 cm): “Ticking starts D+60; upfront 15 bps”

### C2 — Pre-close (\~9m)

* **N21** (L1): “Regulatory/CPs; no funding flows”
* **N22** (L2, **50% transparency**): “Bridge available; undrawn (ticking only)”
* **N23** (L4): “RI underwriting & prospectus build”
* **N2D** (**Diamond** \~1.2 × 1.2 cm, between L1 & L3, slightly right of C2): “Completion?”

### C3 — Close (T1)

* **N31** (L2): “**Draw €12bn** (A + B)”
* **N32** (L1): “Receive EUR; pay seller”
* **N33** (L3): “Settle **DCF @ K** (only if Completion)”
* **N34** (L1, right edge of C3 cluster): “Assets transfer”

### C4 — Rights Issue (T+1m)

* **N41** (L4): “**€6bn fully underwritten RI** — settle”
* **N42** (L2): “Mandatory **prepay Bridge** (A then B)”

### C5 — SFS (T+6–8w)

* **N51** (L5): “**SFS €1.5–2.0bn** — draw”
* **N52** (L2): “Further **prepay Bridge** (finish A; start B)”

### C6 — Bonds (T+9–12m)

* **N61** (L6): “**€4bn EUR bonds** (3y €1.0bn / 5y €2.5bn / 7y €0.5bn)”
* **N62** (L2): “Refinance remainder — **Bridge fully repaid**”

### Contingent failure branch (off N2D)

* **NF1** (L3, slightly below C3): “DCF **lapses** automatically — **no cost**” (add small **red X** overlay)
* **NF2** (L2): “Bridge **not drawn**”
* **NF3** (L1, slightly above): “Only sunk: **upfront + ticking**”

> **Naming:** As you add each box, rename it in Selection Pane (e.g., `N31 Draw 12bn`).

---

# 5) Styles (set once, reuse)

* **Boxes:** White fill, 0.75 pt outline; **titles bold**.
* **Key boxes:** N31, N33, N41, N51, N61, N62 — bold titles (can use slightly darker outline).
* **Line styles:**

  * **Solid (2.25 pt):** Cash/commitments
  * **Thick solid (2.75–3 pt, accent colour):** Mandatory prepayments / take-out
  * **Dashed (2.0 pt, short dash):** Hedge/derivative
  * **Dotted (2.0 pt, round dots):** Contingent / no-completion

Keep colour minimal (neutral greys). Use **one accent** (e.g., corporate blue) **only** for the thick prepayment arrows. Red only for the failure **X**.

---

# 6) Connectors (routing that reads cleanly)

Use **Elbow Connectors** where turns are needed; otherwise **Straight Connectors**. After each connector, **Group** its **label textbox** with the line.

### Core cash path

1. **Bridge commit → draw**

   * From **N12 (bottom edge)** → **N31 (top edge)** (Solid).
   * Label: “Commit → Draw at Close”.

2. **Draw → Buyer → Seller**

   * **N31 (right/bottom)** up into the gap **between L2 & L3**, across, then down to **N32 (top edge)**. Solid; label: “Bridge proceeds (EUR)”.
   * **N32 (right edge)** to **N34 (left/top edge)**, Solid; label: “Purchase price”.

### Hedge settlement (only if Complete)

3. **N13 ⇄ N33**

   * Two short **parallel dashed** connectors between N13 (right edge) and N33 (left edge), offset vertically by \~0.2 cm.
   * Labels: upper “deliver DKK”, lower “receive EUR / or cash P/L”.
   * Alternatively, one **double-arrow dashed** line with single label “Settle DCF @ K (only if Completion)”.

### Mandatory prepayments (thick accent)

4. **RI → Bridge**

   * **N41 (bottom edge)** to **N42 (top edge)** (Thick). Label: “RI proceeds → prepay Bridge”.

5. **SFS → Bridge**

   * **N51 (top edge)** to **N52 (top/left)** (Thick). Label: “SFS proceeds → prepay Bridge”.

6. **Bonds → Bridge**

   * **N61 (top edge)** to **N62 (top edge)** (Thick). Label: “Bond proceeds → refinance remainder”.

> **Dual-tranche clarity (optional):** Create two tiny **anchor dots** near N62 labelled “A” and “B”; split each thick arrow to both anchors to visually imply prepay **A then B**.

### Contingent “no completion” branch

7. **N2D → NF1/NF2/NF3**

   * Three **dotted** connectors fanning to the right:

     * To **NF1** (down-right into L3) with a small **red X** over **NF1**.
     * To **NF2** (straight right into L2).
     * To **NF3** (up-right into L1).

---

# 7) Optional micro-badges (if space allows)

Small rounded tags (\~3.5 × 1.0 cm), light fill, near the top of each event column:

* Over **C4**: “**ND/EBITDA ↓ \~0.8×** on RI settlement”.
* Over **C5**: “**Liquidity +€1.5–2.0bn** (SFS)”.
* Over **C6**: “Final spreads by tenor”.

---

# 8) Optional fee/timing bands (bottom)

Two thin **bands** (rectangles with light outline, 60% grey text, 7 pt) spanning the width at the **bottom** (inside margins):

* **Fees band (C1→C6):**
  “**Margin step-ups (bps):** 0–3m 25 | 3–6m 30 | 7–9m 40 | 10–12m 50 | 13–15m 70 | 16–18m 80 | 19–21m 100 | 22–24m 120”.

* **Ticking band (C1→C3):**
  “**Ticking on undrawn:** 0–2m 0% | 3–5m 10% | ≥6m 30%”.

Group each band as `Band-Fees`, `Band-Ticking` so you can hide them quickly if density is high.

---

# 9) Z-order & grouping (so nothing fights)

1. **Lane bands** (back)
2. **Boxes**
3. **Solid cash lines**
4. **Thick prepayment lines**
5. **Dashed hedge lines**
6. **Dotted contingency lines** + **red X** overlay
7. **Badges & bands**
8. **Legend**

Group logical clusters:

* `Cluster-C1` (N11–N14), `Cluster-C2` (N21–N23, N2D), `Cluster-C3` (N31–N34), etc.
* `Cluster-Failure` (NF1–NF3 + dotted lines + red X).

---

# 10) Mini-legend (bottom-right)

A small box (\~4.8 × 2.8 cm) containing:

* **Line samples:** Solid “Cash/commitments”; **Thick** “Mandatory prepayment”; **Dashed** “Hedge/derivative”; **Dotted** “Contingent”.
* **Shape samples:** Rounded rectangle “Process”; Diamond “Decision”.

---

# 11) Clean typography & hierarchy

* Box titles **bold**; keep to **≤2 lines** per box.
* Use consistent **8–10 pt** body, **10–11 pt** for titles (depending on your deck base size).
* Lane labels in **small caps**, 70% grey.

---

# 12) Quick checklist (so you know you’re done)

* [ ] Title/subtitle + milestone spine with seven columns.
* [ ] Six swimlanes labeled.
* [ ] N-series nodes placed as listed; **N2D** diamond present.
* [ ] **Solid** cash path: N12→N31→N32→N34 with labels.
* [ ] **Dashed** hedge: N13⇄N33 with dual labels (or one double-arrow).
* [ ] **Thick** prepayments: N41→N42, N51→N52, N61→N62.
* [ ] **Dotted** failure fan from N2D to NF1/NF2/NF3 (+ red X on NF1).
* [ ] Optional fee/ticking bands and micro-badges placed or hidden.
* [ ] Legend in bottom-right.
* [ ] Selection Pane objects named and grouped by column/cluster.

## Revenue & Control (internal)

* **Upfront/episodic:** SFS setup, EUR bonds, Green Bond/RCF amendments, EL mandate.
* **Recurring annuity:** SFS admin & spread, SCF/Trade/Guarantees, derivatives carry, RCF usage.
* **Control points:** **ISDA/CSA**, **SFS docs**, **EMTN**, **SLL/RCF** → raise switching costs and keep us “inside the tent”.

## Success KPIs (what good looks like)

* **≥70%** share of FX/IR hedging notional within 6 months.
* **SFS live ≤ T+8 weeks**, capacity **≥€1.5bn**; Phase-2 uplift within 12 months.
* First **EUR benchmark** printed with Mizuho in books; **SLL** signed; **SCF live ≥€300m**.
* **Green Bond** printed within 12–18 months.

## 20-second talk track

“Cross-sell starts now: we anchor **hedging** and stand up **SFS** in weeks, then lock the curve with **EUR bonds**, convert the **RCF to SLL**, and scale **trade/SCF**. That stack gives DSV predictable funding, faster cash, and ESG alignment — and gives us multi-year **recurring revenue** with high switching costs.”
