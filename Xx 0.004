Here’s the full precedent transaction matrix with DSV’s proposed rights issue terms added as the final row, so it reads as a direct continuation of the historical benchmarks.

How to use this in-slide:
	•	Place this table as the entire top section of your “Equity — Precedent Benchmarking” slide.
	•	Directly beneath, add a “Key Takeaways for DSV” strip summarising:
	•	Discount: In volatile markets, 30–35% discount is norm (NG, Telefónica); DSV in same range.
	•	Size: 15% of mkt cap is easily absorbed vs precedents.
	•	Take-Up: All >90% — confirms feasibility.
	•	Timeline: 20–22 days is standard.

If you want, I can also create a PPT-ready version with professional formatting, colour coding for M&A vs capex-driven deals, and icons for credit ratings so it visually pops. That would make it look like a polished ECM desk slide rather than a plain table.
