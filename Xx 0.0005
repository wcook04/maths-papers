love it—here’s a clean 8-box spine (your 6, plus +2 where it actually helps), with tiny off-boxes and tidy connections. No graphics, just the blueprint.

Spine (8 boxes, left → right)
	1.	Board Approves; Mandate
	2.	Sign SPA; Commit Bridge
	3.	Lock DC FX Hedge
	4.	Pre-Close: Ticking Accrues
	5.	Close; Draw €12bn
	6.	Settle Hedge @ K
	7.	€6bn Underwritten Rights Issue
	8.	€6bn EUR Bonds 3/5/7y

Micro off-boxes & connections (4 words max unless noted)

Under 2 — Sign SPA; Commit Bridge
	•	Dual tranches A/B (solid)
	•	Undrawn until close (solid)
	•	Target A- rating (solid)

Between 2 → 3
	•	Completion-contingent (dotted)

Under 3 — Lock DC FX Hedge
	•	Sell DKK / Buy EUR (dashed)
	•	No deal, lapses (dotted)

Under 4 — Pre-Close: Ticking Accrues
	•	Ticking starts D+60 (solid)
	•	Upfront 15 bps (solid)

At 5 — Close; Draw €12bn
	•	Proceeds to seller (solid →)
	•	Funds at EUR price (solid)
	•	Mandatory prepay later (thick → back to Bridge)

At 6 — Settle Hedge @ K
	•	Only if completion (dotted)
	•	Cash or physical (dashed)

At 7 — €6bn Underwritten Rights Issue
	•	Pre-emptive; all holders (solid)
	•	Mandatory prepay bridge (thick ↓)
	•	Rating headroom ↑ (solid)

At 8 — €6bn EUR Bonds 3/5/7y
	•	EMTN Reg S (solid)
	•	Refinance remainder (thick ↓)
	•	Bridge fully repaid (solid ✓)

Tiny failure branch (off a small “Completion?” tag between 4 and 5)
	•	Hedge lapses (dotted)
	•	Bridge undrawn (dotted)
	•	Sunk fees only (dotted)

Time tags (keep general, under the spine)
	•	T-X Prep (1)
	•	T0 Signing (2–3)
	•	T0→T1 (~9m) (4)
	•	T1 Close (5–6)
	•	T+1m Settle (7)
	•	T+9–12m (8)

Line legend (execution logic the room will read instantly)
	•	Solid = cash/commitments
	•	Dashed = hedge/derivative
	•	Dotted = contingent/if no deal
	•	Thick solid = mandatory prepayment/refinance

Why this is the “right” increment
	•	The two extra boxes isolate hedge settlement and bonds, so the equity → debt take-out is unmistakable and rating logic stays crisp.
	•	All numbers match your direction: no securitisation, €6bn RI + €6bn bonds against the bridge draw, with a deal-contingent FX hedge that only bites on completion.
