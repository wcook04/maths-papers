Of course. Here is a script crafted for a sub-90 second delivery, aimed at an audience of junior DCM bankers. It's technical, direct, and built on the research plan.

"Good morning. Quick brief for the week ending August 8th.
The key takeaway is that an extreme supply/demand imbalance, fueled by a dovish macro pivot, created a blowout issuance window this week.
We saw this firsthand with the Wendel deal on Tuesday. The BBB corporate tightened a massive 38 basis points from IPTs, drew a €3.4 billion book for a €500 million print – that's nearly 7 times cover – and priced with a negative 3 basis point New Issue Concession. A classic scarcity premium at work.
The bid for duration was then validated by SEB's 10-year senior non-preferred. It priced inside MS+100, a first for that tenor since before the war in Ukraine, and still saw 2.7 times cover with just a 5 basis point concession.
So what's driving this?
First, the macro catalyst. The Bank of England's split-vote rate cut, prioritizing growth over the UK's 3.6\% inflation, alongside last week's weak US jobs report, has locked in a 'bad news is good news' sentiment, pushing Bund yields down.
Second, the technical engine. You have a wall of cash – European bond funds saw €50 billion of inflows in Q2 alone – chasing almost zero August supply. With secondary markets illiquid, primary is the only release valve, which directly explains the aggressive pricing.
Looking to next week, the entire market is waiting for one number: US CPI on Tuesday. Consensus is for a core print around point-two percent month-on-month. An in-line number keeps this opportunistic window open; a hot number slams it shut.
Pipeline is light – we're tracking The Renewables Infrastructure Group's £150 million sterling deal and hearing chatter of US reverse-Yankees looking at Euro funding.
The strategic call for high-quality clients is clear: if CPI is benign, move now to pre-fund and avoid the crowded September calendar. The pricing power is firmly with issuers.
That's all from me. Happy to take questions."
