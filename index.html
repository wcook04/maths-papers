  <h1>Independent Mathematical Research</h1>
  <p>
    I am an undergraduate independent researcher working outside institutional structures. My work spans combinatorics, numerical analysis, information theory, and statistical inference, and is driven by a desire to uncover rigorous structure in mathematical and algorithmic systems. This page presents recent research papers published on the arXiv.

    <h2><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13433" target="_blank">A Recursive Block Pillar Structure in the Kolakoski Sequence K(1,3)</a></h2>
    <p><strong>Category:</strong> Combinatorics (math.CO)</p>
    <p>
      The Kolakoski sequence K(1,3) is known to possess regularity unlike K(1,2). This work introduces a recursive construction of two sequence families—blocks B(n) and pillars P(n)—which converge to K(1,3). The defining recursions reveal explicit self-similarity tied to the Pisot number α, and the block lengths are shown to grow geometrically with ratio α. The framework provides a new combinatorial lens for interpreting K(1,3)'s regularity and self-encoding property.

    <h2><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12117" target="_blank">The Resonance Bias Framework: Resonance, Structure, and Arithmetic in Quadrature Error</a></h2>
    <p><strong>Category:</strong> Numerical Analysis (math.NA)</p>
    <p>
      This paper analyses the deterministic structure of error in trapezoidal integration of periodic functions. The Resonance Bias Framework interprets quadrature error via spectral filters and phase cancellation effects, rooted in the arithmetic of the function’s frequency relative to grid size. The framework connects numerical error to number theory and offers a structural alternative to conventional stochastic or asymptotic views.

    <h2><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13423" target="_blank">Mixed Fractional Information: Consistency of Dissipation Measures for Stable Laws</a></h2>
    <p><strong>Category:</strong> Information Theory (cs.IT)</p>
    <p>
      Stable laws with infinite Fisher information pose difficulties for classical information theory. This work introduces Mixed Fractional Information (MFI), a dissipation-based measure that remains finite and coherent for symmetric α-stable distributions. Two equivalent formulations of MFI are proven, and a consistency identity is established linking score function differences to entropy dissipation. The measure provides a foundation for exploring fractional analogues of Fisher information and related inequalities.

    <h2><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09029" target="_blank">A Hierarchical Decomposition of Kullback-Leibler Divergence</a></h2>
    <p><strong>Category:</strong> Information Theory (cs.IT)</p>
    <p>
      KL divergence often conceals the source of discrepancy between multivariate distributions. This paper presents a hierarchical, exact decomposition separating marginal divergences from statistical dependencies. Using Möbius inversion on the subset lattice, total correlation is further split into signed contributions from pairwise to higher-order interactions. The decomposition is algebraic and requires no assumptions, enabling detailed diagnosis of divergence origins in probabilistic models.

    <h2><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10667" target="_blank">Beyond Coordinates: Meta-Equivariance in Statistical Inference</a></h2>
    <p><strong>Category:</strong> Statistics Theory (math.ST)</p>
    <p>
      This work introduces the principle of meta-equivariance: optimal solutions to convex matrix optimisation problems remain invariant under affine reparameterisations. The result is illustrated through estimator combination problems in statistics and generalised geometrically to decision theory. The paper offers a foundational insight—distinct from classical equivariance—about the coordinate-independence of optimal decisions under convex objectives.
