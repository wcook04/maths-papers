European utilities are now creating bespoke sustainable finance plans to solve their specific business challenges, abandoning the old one-size-fits-all approach. For example, Anglian Water links money directly to projects, Enel ties its overall borrowing costs to hitting climate goals, while Snam uses a hybrid model to fund both new green tech and its existing gas network. The performance targets are also getting tougher and more detailed, now including emissions from the entire supply chain and alignment with official EU rules. This means sustainable finance is no longer just for show; it has become a fundamental tool for companies to raise the money needed to transform their business and prove their plans are credible.
