Comparative Analysis of Sustainable Finance Frameworks: Enel, Anglian Water, and Snam

Enel demonstrates the most advanced and credible approach with its Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework, embedding KPIs such as absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction and forward-looking EU Taxonomy-aligned capex, directly linking cost of capital to its 1.5°C decarbonisation pathway.
Anglian Water, by contrast, relies primarily on a traditional use-of-proceeds model, supplemented by a single SLB targeting operational and “capital carbon” reductions, signalling progress but showing less holistic integration of corporate climate goals into financing.
Snam adopts a dual-format framework, balancing project-level green bonds with sustainability-linked instruments, but faces significant credibility concerns due to its exclusion of transported gas emissions from Scope 3 reporting, a gap identified by external analysts rather than its SPO.
All three companies disclose ambitious Scope 1 and 2 targets, yet their treatment of Scope 3 varies sharply: Enel addresses only a narrow category, Anglian tackles embodied carbon in infrastructure, and Snam omits its most material category.
EU Taxonomy integration also diverges: Enel uses it strategically as a forward-looking KPI, Snam applies it as a project-screening tool, while Anglian provides minimal disclosure, creating transparency risks.
Finally, the quality of Second-Party Opinions proves uneven—Moody’s offers substantive critique for Enel, DNV’s review of Anglian is procedural, and ISS’s validation of Snam fails to flag its most material omission—highlighting the need for investors to go beyond SPOs in their due diligence.

Would you like me to also trim this into a bullet-point executive brief (3 bullets per company) so you have both a prose and tabular-style takeaway?
