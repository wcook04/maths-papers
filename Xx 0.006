Here’s the board-speed cut — three bullets per floating box, all impact-focused:

⸻

Box 1 – Strategic Relationship
	•	Lead-left on full financing & hedge
	•	Defends client’s ‘A–’ rating
	•	Positions for future M&A mandates

Box 2 – Revenue & Fee Generation
	•	Large bridge underwriting fees
	•	Multi-product monetisation
	•	High-margin FX hedge P&L

Box 3 – Market Position & Franchise Impact
	•	Flagship European transaction
	•	€12bn balance sheet commitment
	•	League table & sector credentials boosted

⸻

This way, the slide reads in under 8 seconds, but still lands the three big wins.


Here you go — all arrow labels for the slide:

Main timeline (blue boxes)
	1.	Board Mandate → SPA Signed — Mandate
	2.	SPA Signed → Pre-Close — Secure
	3.	Pre-Close → Close — Execute
	4.	Close → Pay Seller — Settle
	5.	Pay Seller → Permanent Capital Take-Out — Refinance
	6.	Permanent Capital Take-Out → Post-Deal — Optimise

Side paths (grey boxes)

A. SPA Signed → Close (via “Funding + FX Certainty”) — Backstop
B. Close → Permanent Capital Take-Out (via “Ratings Preservation”) — Stabilise


Got it — if we’re framing this as equity-side storytelling pre-close, pretending the deal is still in play, then we want dates that build anticipation and show why the market’s watching.

Here’s my pick for the 3 to mark on the share price:

⸻

1️⃣ 30 May 2024 — Final bidders confirmed
Field narrowed to 4; DSV seen as front-runner candidate
Label: “Finalists announced — market eyes DSV”

2️⃣ 23–24 Jul 2024 — Two-horse race
Maersk exits; DSV vs CVC head-to-head
Label: “Maersk out — DSV odds improve”

3️⃣ 13 Sep 2024 — SPA signed
DSV chosen; EV €14.3bn agreed, pending approvals
Label: “SPA signed — deal terms locked”

⸻

These three work because:
	•	May shows the first “serious contender” status.
	•	July marks the pivotal competitive shift.
	•	September is the contractual clincher (without implying it’s already closed).

Do you want me to also prepare a short “deal narrative line” that runs under the chart so these dots feel like part of one story arc? That will make the equity slide flow better.
