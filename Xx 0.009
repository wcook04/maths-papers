Here’s how you can take your three-block content and turn it into something visually on par with your other slides — still intern-appropriate, clean, and without overengineering it.

Refined Design Concept — “What Mizuho Stands to Gain”

Layout:
	•	Three equal-width vertical columns across the slide.
	•	Icon at top of each column (large enough to anchor the section).
	•	Title in bold colour bar beneath each icon.
	•	2–3 short bullets under each title, centred vertically in the column.
	•	Keep white space generous so it doesn’t feel dense.

Styling Notes:
	•	Colour accents match your deck’s palette (likely Mizuho blue or gradient).
	•	Icons:
	•	Strategic → handshake icon.
	•	Revenue → coins or stacked bars icon.
	•	Market position → trophy or upward arrow.
	•	Bullet style: short, high-impact phrases — no sentences.
	•	Use even vertical spacing so the bottom of each column aligns.
	•	Add thin vertical dividers between columns to keep it crisp.

If you want, I can prepare this as a ready-to-drop vector layout so you can just paste into PowerPoint and type in the text. That way it’s instantly at the same visual standard as your other slides.
