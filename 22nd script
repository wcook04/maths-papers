Good morning — Friday 22 August. Headline: equities wobbled mid-week led by tech, but credit proved resilient — FIG a touch wider, yet primary kept pricing through.

Tone: supply stayed FIG-heavy and the market absorbed it. Pricing power remained with issuers; concessions were skinny.

Deal colour. Tuesday’s Mizuho 10-year SNP was the bellwether that reopened the long end and gave BBVA confidence to follow. On Wednesday, BBVA printed a €1bn 10-year green SNP: IPTs around MS+135, tightened 27bp to MS+108 on €2.85bn peak, fixed at €1.85bn — \~3bp concession. In practice, BBVA secured 10-year money at levels investors were paying for 5-year paper earlier this summer.

Also Wednesday, Raiffeisen Bank International went for the belly with a €500m 6NC5 SNP. It compressed 30bp to MS+120, priced flat to fair value with 0bp concession, and — crucially — no attrition: the book held at €3bn through the tighten. A straight spread play — and investors paid up.

Covered demand was equally firm: Crédit Agricole’s €1bn green OFH tightened \~7bp with virtually no concession (\~0.5bp), while UniCredit’s €1bn OP still cleared smoothly with a touch more premium (\~1.5bp). Quality prints and the green label added price tension.

Sterling reopened neatly yesterday: Northwestern Mutual back after 14 months with £400m 5-year FA-backed at UKT+70, 12.5bp inside IPTs, books just over £1bn — clean read-through on GBP capacity for high-grade FIG.

Investor flows. In RBI, real money dominated — \~82% asset managers and \~7% insurers/pensions — with the UK taking \~44.8% and France \~19.4%. The split says it all: real money still chasing carry in the belly, while long-end risk was comfortably taken down when offered.

Secondary/spreads. Despite the equity wobble, new issues are holding in — RBI tighter, BBVA around reoffer, covered outperforming — with FIG only marginally wider mid-week via the indices.

Macro & volumes. Macro noise didn’t derail issuance: EMEA ran 17 FIG deals for \~€13.6bn, comfortably >50% of weekly volume and outpacing corporates.

Closing takeaway: the market remains open and absorbing size with minimal concession. Investors are paying up for quality and spread despite equity volatility — setting a constructive tone into September, when calendars should accelerate.
