### **A Proposed Strategic Capital Architecture for the Acquisition of DB Schenker**

**(Final Mandate-Winning Version)**

---

#### **Slide 1: Title & Transaction Overview** (1 minute)

*   **A Proposed Strategic Capital Architecture for the Acquisition of DB Schenker**
*   **Transaction:** DSV A/S to acquire DB Schenker from Deutsche Bahn AG.
*   **Deal Value:** **€14.3 Billion Enterprise Value.** This comprises a €11.3bn payment for equity and the assumption of an estimated €3.0bn in existing Schenker debt.
*   **The Opportunity:** Deutsche Bahn's formal sales process, launched in Q4 2023 due to their €34bn debt burden, creates competitive tension requiring a swift and certain financing solution.
*   **The Mizuho Solution:** A phased, controlled architecture to navigate the financing and accelerate value creation.

#### **Slide 2: Company Profiles & Strategic Fit** (1 minute)

*   **DSV A/S (The Acquirer):**
    *   **Financials (2024):** Revenue ~€22.4bn, industry-leading **10%+ EBIT margin**.
    *   **Proven Integrator:** Successfully integrated Panalpina & GIL, consistently outperforming synergy targets.
*   **DB Schenker (The Target):**
    *   **Financials (2023):** Revenue €19.1bn (normalized from €27.6bn in 2022 as freight rates stabilized), **EBITDA €1.91bn**.
    *   **Market Leader:** #1 in European land transport, #4 in global air freight, with 72,700 employees across 1,850 locations.
*   **The Unbeatable Strategic Fit:** This creates the **only global logistics player that can compete with DHL's scale**, with a clear pathway to lift Schenker's current margins toward DSV's 10%+ standard.

---

#### **Slide 3: The Financing Challenge: A Temporary Stretch** (1 minute)

*   **The Core Problem:** While less severe than initially feared, the acquisition still creates a temporary leverage stretch that requires a sophisticated financing strategy to avoid a significant pricing penalty.
*   **Corrected Pro-Forma Leverage Calculation:**
    *   Pro-forma Debt: €4.6bn (DSV) + €11.3bn (New) + €3.0bn (Schenker Est.) = **€18.9bn.**
    *   Pro-forma EBITDA: €3.1bn (DSV) + €1.9bn (Schenker) = **€5.0bn.**
    *   **Resulting Pro-Forma Leverage = 3.8x.**
*   **The Rating & Pricing Penalty:** Even at 3.8x, the "Negative Outlook" from the sheer size of the acquisition would still command a **150-200bps pricing penalty** versus DSV's target investment-grade state.

---

#### **Slide 4: Solution Overview: The Controlled Deleveraging Architecture** (1 minute)

*   **A Superior Strategy:** We deliberately rejected a US-style Term Loan B, as it would burden DSV with expensive, covenant-heavy debt inconsistent with its investment-grade culture.
*   **The Simple Math:** We strategically accept a **~€300m one-time bridge carry cost over 12 months to achieve over €400m in ANNUAL NPV savings** from superior permanent financing terms.
*   **Visual Timeline:**
    *   **Q1 2025 (Phase 1): Certainty & Validation:** Close the deal with a Bridge Loan & Cornerstone equity.
    *   **Q3 2025 (Phase 2): The Proven Take-Out:** First bond issuance and securitization, backed by synergy proof.
    *   **Q1 2026 (Phase 3): The Growth Refinancing:** Final take-out from a position of undeniable strength.

---

#### **Slide 5: Phase 1 Details: Bridge + Cornerstone + Hedging** (1 minute)

*   **LCM - The Bridge:**
    *   **Instrument:** **€12bn, 12-Month Underwritten Bridge Loan.** Sized for the €11.3bn equity purchase plus buffer. The 12-month tenor accommodates a potential 9-month EU antitrust review.
*   **ECM - The Cornerstone:**
    *   **Instrument:** **€3bn Private Placement** with guaranteed allocation for strategic holders at a **3-5% discount to 30-day VWAP**.
*   **Day-One Leverage Math:** The €3bn equity reduces required new debt to €8.3bn. Pro-forma leverage immediately drops from **4.6x to a more manageable 3.2x**.
*   **DRS - The Hedge:** Deal-Contingent EUR/DKK Forward to eliminate pre-closing FX risk.
*   ***Fallback Plan:*** *If cornerstones decline, the alternative is a fully underwritten Rights Issue to raise the same €3bn with certainty.*

---

#### **Slide 6: Phase 2 Details: Bonds + Securitization** (1 minute)

*   **The Narrative (Q3 2025):** "DSV has **achieved a €40m run-rate on synergies**, validating the integration thesis ahead of schedule."
*   **DCM - The Bonds:**
    *   **Instrument:** €7bn Multi-Tranche Eurobonds (3Y/5Y/7Y tenors).
*   **SFS - The Securitization:**
    *   **The Pitch:** "We **monetize €1.5bn of working capital** from German receivables without any P&L impact or rating agency debt."
*   **Bridge Status:** **€12bn bridge - €1.5bn (Securitization) - €7bn (Bonds) = €3.5bn remaining.**

---

#### **Slide 7: Phase 3 Details: SLB + ABB + Final Paydown** (1 minute)

*   **The Narrative (Q1 2026):** "Leverage is now at 1.6x, significantly beating our target. The integration is a proven success. We are now financing future growth."
*   **Proving the Leverage Math:**
    *   Starting Debt (€18.9bn) - €3.0bn (Cornerstone) - €2.0bn (ABB) - €1.5bn (Securitization) - €3.4bn (Ops Cash*) = **€9.0bn Final Debt.**
    *   Starting EBITDA (€5.0bn) + €0.28bn (Synergies) + €0.4bn (Growth) = **€5.68bn Final EBITDA.**
    *   **Final Leverage = 1.6x.**
*   **DCM - The SLB:** €2.5bn Sustainability-Linked Bond.
*   **ECM - The ABB:** €2bn Accelerated Bookbuild for **"Growth Refinancing."**
*   **Final Bridge Retirement:** The remaining **€3.5bn bridge is retired**: €2.5bn from the SLB and €1.0bn from the ABB. The other €1.0bn raised from the ABB is used for further deleveraging.

#### **Slide 8: Synergy Delivery & Integration Proof Points** (1 minute)

*   **Justifying the Timeline:** Our phased financing is built around these tangible milestones.
*   **NET Cost Synergy Milestones (towards a €280m target):**
    *   **Q2 2025: €25m Annual Savings Identified** from the closure of 20 duplicate facilities.
    *   **Q3 2025: €40m Run-Rate Achieved** from migrating Schenker's German IT.
    *   **Q1 2026: €180m Run-Rate Achieved** with a clear path to the full €280m target (comprising €300m gross savings less €20m customer overlap impact).

---

#### **Slide 9: Why Mizuho Wins** (1 minute)

*   **1. Balance Sheet Power & Credibility:** We can credibly lead-underwrite the **€12bn bridge facility**.
*   **2. European Expertise & Insight:** Unlike US banks focused on leveraged finance, Mizuho's **investment-grade heritage perfectly matches DSV's culture**.
*   **3. Integrated Platform Reduces Risk:** We provide a single point of accountability across LCM, DCM, ECM, SFS, and DRS.
*   **4. Credible Fee Opportunity (€160m):** Bridge Arrangement (125bps) = **~€15m**; Bonds/SLB (40-50bps) = **~€50m**; ECM (1% Cornerstone, 2.5% ABB) = **~€80m**; M&A Advisory (€8m), DRS (€5m), Other (€2m).

---

#### **Slide 10: Risk Management & Conclusion** (1 minute)

*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   **Market Risk:** Mitigated by the phased approach and the upfront Cornerstone de-risking.
    *   **Rating Agency Strategy:** Dialogue with S&P begins Day 1, presenting a clear **18-month path to a stable outlook** based on this architecture.
    *   **Earnings Volatility:** Financing is sized on normalized 2023 EBITDA (€1.9bn), not peak 2022 levels (€2.5bn), providing a conservative buffer.
*   **The Final Pitch:** This is how Mizuho transforms a **leveraged buyout into sustainable value creation.** Our architecture preserves DSV's operational DNA, shareholder value, and crucial **dividend flexibility**, ensuring they are ready for their next acquisition cycle.
